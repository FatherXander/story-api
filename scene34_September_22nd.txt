### Scene 34: September 22nd

Xander’s POV: Today, just as Xander mentioned yesterday, entails killing yet poor bastard with clever words alone. While Xander doesn't need to kill Yurgir (because Astarion didn't make a deal with Raphael, which was the only reason why they killed Yurgir in prior loops), he wants to kill Yurgir anyway. For… more personal reasons, in a sense. Truth be told, this is purely because he loathes Yurgir's treatment of Nessa—Yurgir's displacer beast. Yurgir, being an absolute disgusting bastard, has been charming Nessa's food with a magical substance that forces arousal, and sexually abused the beast for years. Nessa, who looks like a badass big kitty cat, who is supposed to be Yurgir’s beloved companion, is blatantly abused by that fucking bastard. So, Yurgir has to die. No question—no mercy, either. Yurgir is trapped unwillingly inside an old Temple of Shar, tasked with killing Dark Justiciars—a deal Yurgir made with Raphael. The deal, made in the form of a short song, also dictates that all those who hear it must die. And yet, despite ‘completing’ the task, Yurgir is still stuck there. Xander knows why Yurgir is stuck there (a lone Justiciar also made a deal with Raphael, which turn the Justiciar into multiple rats), but deceives Yurgir into believing that it's Yurgir’s men, along with Yurgir, that are the reason the deal isn't completed. Yurgir and Yurgir’s men heard the song, so doesn't that mean they have to die too? Yurgir, persuaded to believe this to be the loophole in the deal, follows through. With the bastard dead, Nessa is now free—something that genuinely pleases him. Shadowheart, excited and humbled to be in Shar’s domain, requests that the party explore the Temple. So, they do just that. The temple is fairly large, but they thoroughly search it. Aside from one specific section, that is. Xander explains that there’s an ally of Ketheric’s here, one that they’d be best to properly prepare for before tackling in battle. Plus, the guy is kind of a prick, so he wants to harass the bastard in a very specific kind of way. They agree to avoid the section this man, Balthazaar, resides in. Even with that one section ‘temporarily off limits,’ they still manage to busy themselves the entire day. This temple was built not only to worship Shar. It was also built to train for Her. To attempt Shar’s Trials in hopes of passing them and becoming a Dark Justiciar. This, being Shadowheart’s main goal, holds incredible weight. The party aids Shadowheart as they tackle Shar’s three trials. One by one, Shadowheart (and sometimes by extension, the party) passes the trials. Upon finishing them all, they find a room called the ‘Silent Library’. Inside, they find animated Dark Justiciar armor guarding a metal gate (that leads to a secret room further inside). Working together, the party makes quick work of the ‘undead’ armor. They avoid a couple traps within the Library itself, and Xander recalls what’s needed to enter the secret room. Retrieving a specific book from the shelf, Xander hands it to Shadowheart. Shadowheart places the book on a pedestal and, sure enough, a secret door reveals itself. Inside lies a magically enhanced set of Dark Justiciar armor, mask, and the Spear of Night (a weapon meant for ritual purposes). However, there’s still another task that must be completed before Shadowheart can prove her worthiness to become Shar’s Dark Justiciar, if should Shadowheart truly choose to do so. But the task cannot be completed yet. Not while Balthazaar is around, and certainly not before the handle more of the Absolute cultists at Moonrise Towers. It won’t take long, though. A week at most. And though Xander doesn’t discourage Shadowheart, nor question her desire to become a Dark Justiciar, he does look…. a little off by the end of the day. Not sad, necessarily. Nothing overt or specific. Pensive, perhaps. Either way. The trials, along with all the exploring and killing throughout the day, has left the party feeling slightly more tired than as of late. They agree to spend the next day doing something more ‘low key,’ and return to camp for the evening.
