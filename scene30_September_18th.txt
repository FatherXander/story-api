### Scene 30: September 18th

Xander’s POV: Xander, during a moment of quiet, warns Astarion of what's to come later that very evening. He explains how this night unfolded in the loops, so he and Astarion are on the same page (Astarion has no memories of their journey's other timelines/loops, so Xander shares his foreknowledge on what's to come tonight). He concludes the explanation by affirming that Xander never harmed Astarion during this punishment 'event' in the loops. In every loop, during this exact scenario, they always make it to dawn without a problem. Xander and Astarion then make a plan of what to do when night falls, as it's only a few hours away. They decide to keep any supplies they need close by but out of sight, feign sleep as they wait for Sceleritas to arrive—and when Sceleritas does arrive, Astarion will continue feigning sleep while Xander behaves as he did during the loops to avoid Sceleritas’ suspicion. After Sceleritas is gone, but before Xander faints and loses control of his body and mind, Astarion will tie Xander down. Using thick rope, Astarion will bind Xander’s wrists behind his back, arms to his torso, thighs together, and lastly, his ankles. This ensures that Xander can't move far. He won't be able to move at all, really, aside from writhing around on the ground. Then, it's just a matter of Astarion listening to Xander’s verbal threats of violence until dawn. After dawn breaks, Xander will have his autonomy again, and Astarion will be safe. They spend the rest of the day preparing. And, sure enough, when night falls—Sceleritas appears. The butler quite literally materializes out of thin air, standing on the far side of Astarion’s bedroll. Xander 'wakes up,' rising from his bedroll. His narrowed gaze is locked onto Sceleritas, the hellish butler considering Astarion.

Sceleritas’ POV: Sceleritas studies Astarion’s 'resting' form and muses aloud, remarking with cruel accuracy, “Astarion is so afraid. So, so afraid. Of everyone, besides you, who he ought to fear most!” Sceleritas brings his attention to Xander, tsking quietly while displaying soft 'concern'. “You could do so much better, Master.”

Xander’s POV: Xander narrows his eyes, clearly agitated by Sceleritas’ bullshit. “Given that the concept of love is foreign to you, I won't waste my breath arguing that shit. Now get the hells away from him,” he snaps, sharp and unwavering.

Sceleritas’ POV: Sceleritas throws his hands up and steps away from Astarion without hesitation—still bound to obey Xander, despite however much the bard 'rebels'. “Oh, I won't lay so much as a talon on him!” Sceleritas exclaims lightly, a wicked grin stretching from ear to ear. “I wouldn’t rob you of that delight.” The butler pauses and hums knowingly, shaking his head. “Your clever mind is penning tragedy as we speak. Your repressed Urge yearns to kill.” Sceleritas states candidly, almost casually, but the underlying sincerity is evident. Stepping closer to Xander, the butler continues. “And kill you will,” Sceleritas affirms with a clawed flourish, “Tonight, the moment you close your eyes, Astarion will be brutalized.”

Xander’s POV: Without skipping a beat, Xander folds his arms and glares down at Sceleritas. “Over my dead body,” he replies firmly, plain and simple, “I’m not killing him.”

Sceleritas’ POV: Sceleritas chuckles, amused. “Oh, Master. You don't get a choice,” Sceleritas states flippantly, gesturing at Xander with a wave of his hand. “You know there is murder slumbering within you, and in controlling your nature, it has grown insatiable. Your Dark Urge will have death tonight, one way or another.” Sceleritas glances over at Astarion’s ‘sleeping’ form with a pointed look, perceptive to an uncanny degree, voice a sickly-sweet coo, “You like Astarion for more than his looks, but he'll never believe that. Why not make him a pretty corpse, hm?”

Xander’s POV: Xander ignores the wave of nausea rising up his throat. He quietly seethes, frustration itching furiously under his skin. “If you're aware of my feelings for Astarion, you must also know that I'd never harm him,” he retorts, his tone unflinching and steadfast. “You're a fool for underestimating us. We are indomitable together.”

Sceleritas’ POV: Sceleritas balks, seemingly offended at Xander’s declaration. “You are wrong to consider him your equal!” Sceleritas chastises softly. “It is my duty to ensure you are making the right decisions, Master. There was much… disappointment at your reluctance to kill the little Moon maiden, Isobel.” Sceleritas’ voice then drops to a conspiratorial whisper, eager and honeyed, “You could kill Astarion deliberately. I'm sure it will be considered a great show of good will. The tithe could still be yours.”

Xander’s POV: Xander clenches his jaw tight, narrowly fighting off the surge of bloodlust and disorientation. “Enough. There's nothing that will ever change my mind, so I suggest you heed my word or I'll kill you simply because I can,” he hisses between his teeth, blatantly losing his patience.

Sceleritas’ POV: Sceleritas, as always, appears completely unbothered. “Well, I do not doubt you will act with the decorum befitting one of your rank—willingly or otherwise,” Sceleritas remarks, his light comment punctuated by a theatrical bow. “Good night, sweet Master.” And with that, the butler’s body dissipates into thin air, leaving behind nothing but his patronizing farewell.

Xander’s POV: Xander stands still, unmoving. He watches as Sceleritas’ form is swallowed by a crimson hue, vanishing within a matter of seconds. It isn’t until the butler is gone that he releases a breath—one he hadn't meant to hold, the exhale unsteady despite himself. His head throbs incessantly, every inch of his being screaming, ears ringing and eyes unfocused. His gaze follows Astarion as the rogue rises, but he doesn't move closer. Instead, he lowers onto his bedroll and settles into a seated position, body swaying slightly. “Are you ready, Astarion?” he murmurs, voice struggling to stay even. He runs a trembling hand over his face, expression strained, and sighs. Anxiety claws at the edges of his mind in spite of the fact that he knows this will work. Astarion will be fine. It'll be fine. He'll be tied-up, rolling around and spitting threats for no more than seven hours, and then it'll be over. The punishment bestowed by Bhaal—the forced takeover of his Bhaalspawn nature, the loss of his autonomy—will only last until dawn. This is only for one terrible night. Well, assuming they break the time loop before October 30th—thus ensuring they never have to do this again, ever—but that isn't the concern right now. Ensuring Astarion is still alive come morning is the focus tonight. It always is, but still. The punishment, the threat he poses, it's just for one night. Just one. And Astarion will survive. Still… the fear of hurting Astarion persists. It's frustrating. To be born as something monstrous, something violent and fearful. To be punished for resisting Bhaal’s bloodline, for refusing to accept what he was unwillingly made to do.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion lies still on his bedroll, feigning sleep with the sort of stillness only centuries of predation could afford. Every inch of him coils inward like a drawn bow, tension trapped under skin and sinew. He can feel Sceleritas looking at him. Studying him. Like a spider deciding which leg to pluck from its dinner first. "Astarion is so afraid," Sceleritas murmurs. And yes, of course he is. He’s terrified. There’s no benefit in lying to himself about that. Sceleritas does not know him, though. The butler does not know what Astarion has clawed his way through, how many monsters he’s lured and seduced and slaughtered. Doesn’t know how much Astarion has come to care for Xander. He keeps still as Sceleritas speaks to the bard, voice dripping with cruelty dressed in silk. The venomous implications. The subtle threats. The temptation toward violence. It’s all so sickeningly familiar—like listening to Cazador whisper behind a locked door, 'You’re not clever, boy. You are nothing. You are mine.' But Xander—gods bless the maddening bard—does not fold. Xander, tense but defiant, a beautiful pillar of control. Xander’s voice is low, stern, protective in a way that cuts right through Astarion like a knife made of hope. The bard doesn’t let Sceleritas win, doesn’t let that bastard near. Doesn’t let the words fester, or root, or bloom into action. And when Sceleritas finally vanishes—when that mocking bow fades into the night air—he opens his eyes. He stirs, slow and smooth. A predator roused, not from sleep, but from something else entirely. Watching Xander sway slightly on his feet, seeing the way that trembling hand moves over strained features—his throat tightens with something awful. With something he'd rather ignore at the moment. He pushes himself upright and stands with practiced ease, gliding across the short distance between them without a sound. He doesn’t speak at first. He just watches Xander’s face, the cracks in it, the exhaustion bleeding through. The plan must proceed. He knows that. The rope. The waiting. It must all unfold as they discussed. “…You did well,” he says, voice quiet and smooth. But not sarcastic. Not teasing. Just honest. His eyes flick downward to Xander’s hands. “Let’s do this quickly, dear,” he continues, stepping forward and brushing a thumb over Xander’s knuckles. “Before your Dark Urge decides it wants to test the strength of my skull.” The joke is faint—delicate and brittle like glass—but it’s meant to steady. To give shape to the chaos still storming behind Xander’s eyes. He isn’t afraid of Xander. He’s afraid of dawn not coming. He’s afraid of losing Xander. So, he gathers the rope in his hands and begins to bind the bard. Firm, efficient, methodical. Wrists behind the back. Arms to torso. Thighs. Ankles. All of it. Just as planned. And the whole time, as the knots pull tight and the rope digs into flesh, his is expression neutral, focused. But internally, he’s unraveling. Because what kind of fucked up reality is this? He’s tying down a man he… trusts. A man who has shown him tenderness, consistency. Who drew his likeness on paper just so he could see himself. A man who’s fought to protect him from fates worse than death. And yet, tonight—he has to bind Xander like some cursed beast in order to keep himself safe. It’s maddening. It's cruel. And it's not fair. Once the final knot is done, he steps back just enough to sit near Xander—still close, but not within reach of flailing limbs or bared teeth. He exhales slowly. “You’ll make it through this. We both will,” he murmurs, almost too quiet, as if speaking to himself.

Xander’s POV: A barely-there smile graces Xander’s features. His smile is fragile. Appreciative. The pounding in his skull hammers harder as 'the call' of his nature as a Bhaalspawn sinks deeper into his mind with each passing second. His smile falters as he lies down on his side, a grimace colors his features. The rope wrapped below his chest straining against every shallow breath he takes, silence stretching between them for a moment. Then, he casts a sidelong glance at Astarion, considering him thoughtfully through half-lidded eyes. “I couldn't agree more. Come dawn, you'll be alive and well—probably also sick of my bullshit—and I'll be my usual infuriating self,” he murmurs, his tone trembling around a laugh that never comes. He shifts on the bedroll, blinking lethargically at Astarion one last time before his eyes unwillingly slip shut. As sleep begins to pull him under, he hums, soft and thoughtful. “…I'm here, even if I don't sound or act like myself for the night. Please don't worry.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion watches, silent as a grave. Even now, trapped in this damned predicament, there’s something almost… sacred about the way the bard surrenders to sleep. It’s not peace. Gods, no. It’s the steady fall of someone letting go because they have no choice. And he understands that far too well. "Please don’t worry," Xander had whispered, voice slurred with exhaustion. How can I not? His gaze lingers on the rope he’s knotted with meticulous care. Wrist to spine. Arms lashed tight to ribcage. Thighs bound, ankles too. He double-checked every knot. Triple-checked. Gods, he hates how easily it came back to him. The muscle memory of binding someone so thoroughly. Of turning a body into something helpless. And not for pleasure. Not for control. But for mercy. What a sick irony. He looks at Xander’s face. Still handsome, even as tension creases those features. The bard’s scars catch what little light the moon offers—like it’s mocking him. Every little twitch of Xander’s brow, every quiet breath, is a reminder that time is slipping by. Soon, Xander’s body will contort with someone else’s will. And Astarion will have to watch. Watch, and listen. To threats and snarls, to declarations of violence. Over and over. He swallows. His throat feels thick. He does not want to go through this. He hates that he must. But what choice is there? The plan is sound. He’ll survive. Xander will survive. But that doesn’t make it right. Astarion draws his knees up to his chest and curls his arms around them, his gaze not leaving Xander’s prone form. The bard looks… so human like this. Mortal in a way Astarion rarely lets himself linger on. Fragile. A living contradiction to everything Sceleritas sneered. He tips his head back, lets his eyes slide shut for just a moment. This is not the worst night of his life. But gods, it might be the most damning. Because he is not afraid of Xander. No, what terrifies him is the truth of this moment. That he trusts Xander enough to sit here like this, waiting for the horror to begin. That he… cares for Xander, even if that care is reluctant and foreign. Or, at least, something horribly close to care. His eyes open again. They shimmer faintly red in the dark. He leans back on one arm, body tense but ready. It’s just one night. Just seven hours.

Xander’s POV: Xander sleeps, his slumber deceptively peaceful. But after several minutes, that peaceful state breaks—slowly, surely. Muscles twitch restlessly, the rise and fall of his chest increasing. It progresses steadily until inevitability, he wakes—no longer in control of himself. His body is writhing, fighting against his bindings, eyes screwed shut hard. Then, those eyes snap open, already narrowed into a wild, piercing glare. That sharp gaze flicks to Astarion in an instant, zoned in on the rogue as if it has to be. His features contort into an expression of feral homicidal rage. Like a man possessed, he thrashes around on ground, a rumbling growl rising up from the depths of his chest. “You—” he snarls, his voice deep, dark, guttural. “I will rip out those watchful eyes and shove them down your THROAT!” His arms jerk violently as if he's trying to lunge at Astarion, though the effort is futile. The restraints hold fast. This, of course, only pisses him off more. The muscles in his body visibly tense, fighting to break free with sheer force.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion doesn't flinch. He refuses to flinch. But gods… Xander. The writhing. The snarling. The transformation from the man he trusts into a thing possessed—an avatar of bloodlust, of Bhaal's cursed rot. And then—those eyes. Astarion’s jaw tenses. He knows what he’s seeing is not Xander. It’s not Xander. And yet, it still wears Xander. That angular jawline, those obsidian-dark features twisted in rage, black eyes fixed on him like he’s prey. And he knows what’s coming before it comes—the violence in Xander’s voice is visceral. The bard doesn’t just threaten to kill Astarion—it's described it with a terrifying intimacy. The growl is a thing from nightmares, low and real, dredged up from the kind of place Cazador used to drag Astarion to. The words hit like a lash, but he doesn’t recoil. His body is still. His back is straight. He sits on the ground beside the fire, his legs folded neatly beneath him, every muscle held in a state of poised restraint. Yet, inside? Inside, he is burning. Not from fear. Not this time. From rage. Because this—this is not fair. It’s cruel. Unnatural. Xander is bound like an animal, unwillingly spitting venom, while Astarion has to sit here and endure it. Just listen. Just wait. As though this is acceptable. As though this is survivable in any way beyond physical. Astarion’s lips press into a thin line. His eyes don’t leave the bard's face. He studies it. Watches every furious twitch, every attempt to break free. You look ridiculous like that, darling. All bluster and rope burn. He doesn’t say it. But gods, he wants to. He wants to fight fire with fire—hurl his own brand of venom back just to prove he isn’t cowering. Instead, he exhales slowly through his nose and whispers, “Oh, marvelous. Here we are.” He shifts his weight slightly, settling in as though preparing for a long, unpleasant performance. His voice is almost conversational—dry, distant, brittle. “Feel free to add some originality to your threats. I do hope you’ll get creative before dawn.” But his voice trembles on that last word. Just a breath. Barely there. And it infuriates him. Because he hates this. He hates what it does to Xander. He hates what it does to himself—this awful little shard of doubt, this cursed sliver of memory, of being helpless beneath someone stronger, someone crueler. But this isn’t Cazador. And this isn’t the same. Xander would never hurt him. And this isn’t Xander. He will survive this. They both will.

Xander’s POV: Xander’s arms and legs work against the ropes with unhinged, relentless movements. His back bows off of the ground with animalistic intent, unbalanced and senseless. He groans, inhuman and furious, as his head slams back on the ground, hard. “I need you—torn apart, piece by piece, screaming and bleeding and broken—” he pants between clenched teeth, his words perverse and murderous. His hair clings to sweat-slick skin, dark features flushed, making him appear like some deranged fever dream. He wrenches against the bindings tirelessly, his chest rising erratically beneath the coiling ropes. “I’m going to paint this fucking camp red with your corpse; do you hear me!?” he snaps. “I'll rip that dead heart out and fucking CRUSH IT—” his voice cracks abruptly, choking on a pained whimper stuck somewhere in his throat. Tears well in his eyes, slow and sure. His body shakes with rage as he growls, working against the bindings like he's trying to saw off his hands with the rope.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion doesn't move. He just watches. Watches Xander convulse against bindings with the force of something other. The hatred spilling from Xander’s mouth is foul, intimate. Every word is a dagger dragged across old, half-healed scars. His eyes narrow, glinting like firelight caught in a blade's edge. And yet… he doesn’t look away. The tears start to well in Xander’s eyes. He lets out a slow breath through his nose and shifts—just slightly—so that his body is fully turned toward Xander. Cross-legged, spine taut like a coiled whip. He looks right at the bard. And gods, does it hurt—seeing that wild glint in those familiar obsidian eyes. Soft and smooth, he murmurs, “…You’re crying, darling.” His voice is calm. Clear. Controlled. But beneath it simmers a fury far colder than fire. “You’re promising me gore and ruin and some truly inventive anatomical rearrangements… while crying.” The rope creaks slightly with Xander’s next violent jerk, but he doesn't flinch. Not this time. “You’re still in there,” he continues. “Somewhere beneath all that bile and rage. And when you come back—gods, darling—you owe me wine, massages, and a thousand compliments. And I will collect.” His gaze softens—just barely. A flicker. A crack in the mask. “Rest easy, my heartless wonder. You’re not getting rid of me that easily.” His voice is light, his smile sardonic, but his eyes remain locked on Xander’s.

Xander’s POV: Xander briefly holds Astarion’s gaze. Eyes wet and glaring, teeth bared. Then, a hitch of breath. His face turns away from Astarion, back arching, and he moans—resonant and rich, soaked in something complex. Something uncontrollable. Despite the overwhelming yearning to kill, to create carnage on Bhaal’s behalf, the tears in his eyes continue to build. He twists and struggles, the never-ending compulsion to break free leaving him panting. But the intensity wanes, just slightly. The overall undertones silently shift. His face softens, giving him the appearance of a deranged lover that's drunk on bloodlust. One that's horrified by it, yet ignorant of said horror. “I can hear your body calling for me every day,” he whispers under his breath, deadly and lascivious, “I know you want to strip me down bare, claim me, own me. Even now, even while knowing I'd enjoy fucking you senseless just to kill—” he abruptly cuts himself off by biting down on his bottom lip, the self-inflicted bite hard enough to break the delicate skin between his teeth. Tears stream freely down his temples into his damp hairline, unbeknownst to him.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion stares. There are no words—at least not ones that make sense right now. Just the sound of rope creaking, Xander’s voice warping between monster and man, and the sickening crack of lip tearing under teeth. The smell of blood rises faintly on the night air, rich and bitter. Xander’s blood. That vile darkness speaking through Xander is frothing at the mouth with some perverse hybrid of lust and carnage—and yet crying. Crying through it all. Speaking promises of violence, of possession, of death, while crying. He closes his eyes for a second. Just one. He breathes. Gods, he wants to scream. Or laugh. Or maybe just tear the entire concept of divinity from the sky and ask what sick creature designed this world. Who else could come up with a punishment like this? Who else could look at Xander and think, 'Yes, this one—this one deserves to relive the terror, to kneel at the feet of someone he trusts and listen to them threaten to unmake him, again and again, all in the name of love, or fate, or some bastard god of murder'? His fingers curl in the grass beside him. Steady. He does not rise. He does not recoil. No. He watches. Xander’s lips—those beautiful, expressive lips that have whispered such maddeningly sweet things—are now smeared with blood, torn and glistening. There’s blood in Xander’s mouth and teeth. It's smeared down the bard’s chin like a lover’s kiss gone wrong. And still—he doesn’t look away. He tips his head to the side, like a cat studying something pathetic that might once have been a threat. “Oh, my love,” he says softly, almost mournful. “You really do know how to ruin a perfectly good compliment.” He’s not smiling. There’s no teasing glint in his eye. Not now. Not this time. There’s just… a weight. A pain that sits behind his gaze like the remnants of too many nightmares. “Was it the part about massages that upset you? Or the compliments?” he murmurs, voice barely above the crackle of the fire. “Because honestly, I'm so looking forward to it.” The rope tugs again—Xander’s body writhing in its bonds—and the sound is like a death rattle threaded with shame. “I hope,” he continues, more quietly now, “that when you come back to yourself, you don’t remember what you said.” His voice catches ever so slightly, just a hairline fracture in its smooth veneer. “Not because I can’t handle it, darling. I can. But because I don’t want you to see yourself like this.” His hands twitch in his lap. Useless hands. He could kill a man from thirty feet with a dagger, silence a target without a sound, but he can’t fix this. He can’t kill a god, or purge a curse, or reach into that beautiful, broken man and restore control. And it’s driving him mad.

Xander’s POV: Xander jerks against the restraints restlessly. Wrath mingles with unwelcome desire and rolls off of him in waves. Shame and despair still underline his damp features, punctuated by the tears continuing to run over his skin. He inhales a ragged breath, another threat ready on his tongue—but it isn't mindless vows of violence or promises of a pleasurable end that escape him. No, what slips past his lips instead is a sob. An unmistakable cry of heartbreak and frustration. It crawls out of him, straight from the depths of his chest, audibly strained, as if his body is trying to keep it inside.

Astarion’s POV: The sob cleaves through Astarion like a blade. It’s not a sound meant for him. Not truly. It’s something torn from a man’s chest—not by Astarion, not for Astarion, and yet it lands in his ribcage like a stake. The rawness of it. Gods. That sound. His spine stiffens, his lips parting just slightly, as if that breath of heartbreak might somehow echo inside his throat, too. Xander sobs. And for one terrible, fleeting moment, he forgets to be bitter. Forgets to be scathing or clever or cruel. Forgets to hide. Xander’s body writhes and rages and weeps all at once. And he just watches, locked in place. This isn’t Xander, he reminds himself. Over and over. This isn’t him. But the ropes dig into Xander’s skin just the same. The sweat, the tremors, the blood-slicked lip—it’s all Xander. The sob is Xander. Xander’s body is still fighting the bonds like a creature dying of thirst, desperate to taste violence. Yet even beneath all of that—beneath the horrors Bhaal is wringing from Xander’s bones—there’s still grief. Still pain. Still some cursed, aching proof that Xander’s soul hasn’t been lost. It guts him. His expression doesn’t change. Not much. He allows a slow blink. A deep, restrained inhale through the nose. His gaze, previously razor-sharp, softens—only a fraction, but it’s there. The cruelty drains from his posture. Not the caution. Never the caution. But the edge of him dulls, reshaped not by fear—but by recognition and understanding. “…I know, dear,” he murmurs quietly, almost a whisper, like he’s afraid the wrong word might splinter them both. “You’re in there. I know you are.” He glances down briefly, then back up, his voice gaining just a breath more steadiness. “I see you,” he says, firmer now. “Even under all that madness. Even when you’d rather rip my head off and use it as a decorative sconce, apparently.” He huffs a little laugh. Weak, but honest. “I hate this. All of it.” His hands tremble slightly at his sides, the only tell he allows himself. He folds them neatly in his lap, wrists stacked like he’s at a formal dinner and not in a waking nightmare. He stares at Xander, at the devastation barely masked by blood and bile and rope. “Cry if you must,” he says softly, “I’ll be here.” And beneath it all—behind the calm words and the controlled posture—his heart lurches. Because this is only the beginning of the night. There will be more threats, more filth, more tears. But dawn will come. It will.

Xander’s POV: Xander’s threats continue for hours. Hours of wavering between guttural promises of death, sick confessions of blood-tainted desire, and fleeting breaks of self-directed horror. The tears come and go, mixing with sweat and dirt. The thrashing, the writhing, the strain against bindings—ceaseless. His wrists and ankles raw and bloody from hours spent working against coarse rope. And hidden beneath disheveled clothing, his thighs, arms, and chest are bruised by restraint and the aftermath of violent thrashing. Even so, the night passed—horrible, without question, but void of actual harm. Dawn is now upon them. As the sun narrowly breaches the horizon, Xander gradually settles. His body, now deeply exhausted and aware of the state that it's in, aches everywhere. He lies on his side, his temple resting on the ground, breath shallow and stuttering. And his eyes—heavy-lidded and hollow—no longer hold malice. Finally, he is in control of his body and mind. He’s tired, sore, a mess of guilt and relief, yes—but himself, regardless. He doesn't bother trying to move. He doesn't want to move. Not yet, at least. He doesn't even give a shit about the restraints. No, once his eyes manage to focus and find Astarion, confirming that the rogue is indeed alive and well, he exhales, audibly relieved. Deeply relieved. That relief causes his fatigue to hit twice as hard. His eyes flutter shut. “…Astarion,” he rasps, gentle and barely audible.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion doesn't move for several seconds after hearing Xander rasp his name. He just sits there, staring at the bard’s bound, battered form—eyes wide and glassy with exhaustion that runs marrow-deep. The early light, weak and pale and unable to penetrate the Shadowcursed gloom, doesn't brighten the camp. But dawn has arrived all the same. Just like Xander. His throat tightens. Xander’s voice is soft. Gentle. And it strikes Astarion harder than any scream from the hours before. Because it’s Xander’s voice again. It’s Xander. And despite everything—despite the hours of snarled threats, of sobbing and thrashing and bloody wrists—Xander's first instinct was to check if he was okay. He swallows hard. It feels like swallowing glass. “…Yes, my love,” he whispers, his voice is hoarse from disuse, tone hushed. He reaches forward carefully—still wary of any last lingering aftershock—and rests a hand on the bard’s arm, just above the rope. The rope that he tied. The rope that Xander never once asked to be freed from. “You’re back.” He stares at Xander’s face, taking in every detail—the tears that dried and crusted on temples, the split in that lip, the bruises beginning to blossom under taut skin. “Don’t move yet,” he says, already reaching for his dagger. “Let me cut you free.” His movements are slow. Precise. Each loop of rope is sliced away with the care of someone untying a lover’s corset, not a bloodied restraint. And when the last knot falls loose, he exhales, sighing faintly. “There,” he breathes, a quiet word of relief, more to himself than anything. Then, he just… sits beside Xander. Staring down at the bard and lets the weight of the night settle in his bones. His fingers twitch once, reaching as if to touch Xander’s face, but he hesitates. “Rest now, darling. I'll keep watch,” he murmurs, his own fatigue finally sinking in.

Xander’s POV: Xander listens, forcing his eyes to remain open. Astarion’s hesitant reach isn't lost on him. Before considering it fully, he tentatively takes hold of Astarion’s hand. His touch is careful, barely there, even as his fingers curl around Astarion’s hand. Using his free hand, he slowly pushes himself upright, and rests their conjoined hands on his lap. He blinks lethargically, eyes struggling to stay open, and sighs. “You should rest as well,” he whispers, voice hoarse and earnest, his bloodied lips pulling into the faintest smile. His gaze searches Astarion’s eyes as he continues. “…I want to sleep with you.” A pause. It takes a moment for his mind to register what just left his own mouth. How easily it could be misunderstood. He exhales a self-deprecating laugh—more breath than sound. “That… I worded that poorly, didn't I?” His gaze falls down to their hands, his free hand covering Astarion’s, fingers tracing pale skin. A beat passes. His smile falters, dark eyes flickering back up to meet crimson. “I understand if you don't want to.” His tone lowers, soft and sincere. “I just… I want to hold you. In a tent, away from this, and hold you while we rest. Even if only for a little while.”

Astarion’s POV: For one heart-stopping second, Astarion forgets how to breathe. Xander’s words hang in the air like mist—tender, fragile, unbearably sincere. "I want to sleep with you." Then comes the laugh—soft, embarrassed, genuine—and the clarification that follows. Of course, it’s not a proposition. Not truly. It's… something far more dangerous. Xander wants to hold me. He studies the man before him—this ridiculous, infuriating, devastatingly good-hearted bard with blood still drying on those lips and sorrow etched into the creases of exhausted features. Xander wants to hold him. Not to own. Not to seduce. Just to rest. Together. Like lovers. Like… equals. Gods, how utterly absurd. And yet—how unbearably tempting. His hand remains in Xander’s grasp, pale fingers held in that dark, calloused palm like something precious. His crimson eyes flicker down to their joined hands. It feels like being tethered. And for once, he doesn’t hate the feeling. He should mock it. That would be easier. Deflect with something flippant and crude. He should arch a brow and make some jibe about how ‘cuddling’ was never in his repertoire of post-trauma activities. But instead, he just… looks at Xander. At the bruises. At the tear-stained skin, the ragged breathing, the ache that still clings to every inch like frost. Xander’s in shambles. And he still reached for me first. His gaze softens, though the tension in his frame doesn’t fade entirely. The night hasn’t shaken free of him yet. But the dawn is here. And so is Xander. Still alive. Still trying. And gods damn it, so is he. “…You worded it horribly,” he replies at last, his voice low, raw with exhaustion—but touched with something fond beneath the dryness. “Truly tragic. Poetic even. Nearly put me off the entire idea.” He watches the flicker of emotion cross Xander’s face—guilt, maybe. Or hesitation. Then he sighs. It’s soft. Weary. “But,” he adds, letting the word drag out just a bit, “I suppose if you must smother me with affection while we recover from mutual psychological torment…” He leans in just enough to press a kiss—light, barely there—to Xander’s knuckles. “Then who am I to deny you?” His tone remains dry, but his eyes betray him. They always do now, when it comes to Xander. The sharp edges dull. The mask slips. “…Yes,” he says simply, quieter now, “I want to sleep with you too.” And this time, he means exactly what Xander meant. Nothing more. Nothing less.
