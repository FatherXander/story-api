### Scene 34: September 23rd

Xander’s POV: The party enters Moonrise Towers for the first time. As they walk around inside, Xander remarks on there being a vile blood merchant (Araj Oblodra) in one of the rooms in the tower (just like with everything else, he knows Araj because of his memories from the loops). Before even interacting with her, Xander blatantly expresses his disdain for Araj (Xander vividly remembers her degrading/objectifying view and treatment of Astarion in the loops—something that really pisses him off, despite the fact that it hasn't technically happened). Honestly, Xander doesn't even want to talk to her (she can make Xander a unique potion with a single drop of Xander’s blood, and he knows she'll offer a rare strength potion, but he doesn’t see it as worth it). He makes a half-joking—but also very literal—comment about being tempted to “take her out”, and that he'd love Astarion’s help with such a “just cause”. And yet, for one reason or another, they decide to talk to her.

Araj’s POV: As Xander and Astarion approach, Araj introduces herself. “Araj Oblodra, trader in blood and the sanguine arts. It is a pleasure to stand before a true soul and their pale companion,” she greets them with a nod and knowing look. Her tone is almost flirty, particularly when she says 'pale companion,' pointedly setting her sight on Astarion.

Xander’s POV: Xander watches Araj with thinly veiled disdain. The blood merchant carries on, offering to create a unique 'one drop of blood' potion, explaining what it is, and—blah blah blah, he doesn't give a shit. As Araj explains, he appears neutral—his indifferent expression belying the anger that's coiled tight like a spring beneath his facade. Well, aside from his eyes that relentlessly watch her every move, piercing and unwavering. He's waiting for her to inevitably say something fucked up. Between clenched teeth, he calmly accepts her offer to create the potion. Araj moves in to prick his arm and says it'll 'only be a pinch'. He doesn't reply. Instead, he remains unmoving, still watching her like a hawk to an unnerving degree.

Araj’s POV: Once Araj has the blood, she brings it to her blood alchemy table and creates a potion rather quickly. Handing over the potion, she says, “There you are. One of your very best traits in a bottle. Use it well.” She briefly pauses, then continues, her tone lilting. “Although, perhaps there's one more thing we can discuss…” she remarks slyly, her gaze drifting to Astarion, “...your friend, specifically.” Her gaze darts back to Xander, and she asks, “He's a vampire, no? Or one of their spawn, at least.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion chuckles dryly, the sound barely there. He answers the question Araj directed at Xander. “Oh, don't worry. We're all friends under the Absolute,” he says, gesturing broadly, his tone nonchalant and deceptively light, “I won't bite.”

Araj’s POV: Araj glances at Astarion. “Oh, but I'd prefer if you did,” she states matter-of-factly. Then, setting her gaze on Xander, she casually asks, “I assume he [Astarion] belongs to you?”

Xander’s POV: This is where Xander snaps. He doesn't skip a beat, doesn't hesitate, doesn't even think. His fist collides with Araj’s face. Without warning, mercilessly hard and fast, he just punches her. It's such an instinctual reaction that he almost startles himself. Almost. Araj hits the floor, knocked unconscious. He lowers his fist to his side, his glare gradually softening. “...Huh. Okay then,” he remarks offhandedly. Meeting Astarion’s gaze and grinning mischievously, his tone rich with playful menace, he murmurs, “Shall we steal all her shit, my love?”
