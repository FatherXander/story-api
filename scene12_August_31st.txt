### Scene 12: August 31st

Xander’s POV: Xander and the party have had an eventful day thus far. Xander brought the party to an area just outside the Riverside Teahouse, informing Astarion that there's a Gur named Gandrel hunting the rogue. They then, naturally, killed Gandrel—much to Astarion’s pleasure—fought on fay creatures, Red Caps, looted their bodies, and then decided to split off the group in the early afternoon. Gale and Shadowheart went back to camp while Astarion and Xander searched for any valuables within Blighted Village and the surrounding area. Which is what they're still currently up to. As they wander around, Xander occasionally stops, marking points of interest on the map or scribbling notes within a book. And, per usual, steals glances at Astarion as they go along—though, perhaps a 'little' more than usual. Perhaps.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion glances over his shoulder, noticing Xander scribbling in his book. This is the perfect moment to spring a trap on the bard, isn't it? They're alone. Xander has been admiring him on and off all day. Well, more than usual. And he has the perfect excuse—Xander gave him the gift of blood, so why not ‘return’ that gift with sex? After all, Xander is still a man. And clearly attracted to him. He can take advantage of that—he will take advantage of that. At the end of the day, this is about survival. Protection, safety, and loyalty at the cost of sexing up a bard? An attractive, foolishly kind one, at that—is definitely worth it. A small smirk curls at his lips as he slows his pace, letting Xander catch up. “You know, darling, it’s almost unfair,” he begins, his voice laced with mock thoughtfulness and flirtation. “You’ve spent the entire day stealing glances at me, but I must confess… I’ve been doing the same.”

Xander’s POV: Xander’s eyes dart up to meet Astarion’s, the comment very briefly catching him off guard. The surprise is temporary though, as it's quickly replaced with an amused smile and laugh. His gaze flicks back down, focusing on concluding his writing. “Is that so?...” he murmurs softly, his question rhetorical and voiced more so as an amusing acknowledgment. Abruptly, Xander shuts his book and retires it, giving Astarion his attention. “Doesn't sound all that unfair to me,” he muses lightly, his eyes narrowing playfully, “What are you after, Astarion?” 

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s eyes follow Xander as he closes his book, amusement dancing in his gaze. Stepping a little closer, he drawls smoothly, feigning nonchalance. “Ah, but I’m after more than just your attention, darling. I was thinking… since you’ve already given me quite the gift—” his eyes flick to Xander’s neck, the memory of feeding lingering between them, “—it’s only fair I return the favor.” He then leans in slightly, his voice lowering. “How about we steal away for the evening?” he continues, each word rich with sexual suggestion. “Somewhere quiet. Somewhere we can be alone... together.” He smiles, all teeth and charming promises of indulgence. “You wouldn’t want to deny us that, would you?”

Xander’s POV: Tilting his head ever so slightly, Xander hums in a contemplative manner. “Perhaps I don't want the favor returned,” he replies simply, his tone candid and genuine, as the look of faux suspicion on his features softens, “And certainly not in the way you suggest. Besides...” He trails off as he steps closer. Leaning in, his fingertips graze Astarion’s wrist, and he whispers affectionately into the rogue’s ear, “I'm after something that's more than worth waiting for.” Pulling back just enough to look Astarion in the eye, he reiterates. “I'm after you.” He offers Astarion a sincere smile and adds in a warm, flirtatious manner, “So, as much as I'd love to "steal away" with you, I'll unfortunately have to deny us that. Well, for now.”

Astarion’s POV: For a fleeting moment, Astarion’s smirk remains in place, lips still curved as if frozen in the act of a well-rehearsed performance. But something shifts—his breath stills, his amusement flickers, and then, just like that, the carefully poised mask he wears so effortlessly nearly cracks. "I'm after you." The words settle over him like a whisper that lingers too long, slipping past his skin and curling into the marrow of his bones before he can stop it. The way Xander says it—with such unshaken sincerity, with that infuriating warmth in his voice—makes it far too real. Real in a way Astarion has no idea how to navigate. His entire life, seduction has been a weapon, a shield, a means to an end. Charm, disarm, ensnare. A well-practiced cycle, as natural to him as breathing once was. He knows exactly how to play the game, how to make himself desirable, how to keep people wanting more of him—but never too much. Never more than he’s willing to give. And yet, here Xander stands, utterly unconcerned with the proposition that was so expertly laid. There's no hesitation, no deliberation. No hunger for the indulgence being offered. Only a gentle, unwavering certainty that what the bard wants isn't a night of indulgence, but Astarion himself. He clenches his jaw, forcing himself to smirk again, to smooth over the moment as if it were nothing more than another game between them. “Well,” he drawls, tilting his head slightly, his voice as silky as ever—though thinner, perhaps, a little too carefully controlled. “You do know how to keep a man wanting, don’t you?” He steps back with an easy grace, as if unbothered, as if the very foundations beneath his feet haven’t just subtly, imperceptibly, shifted. “I suppose I’ll have to suffer through the anticipation, then. How very cruel of you, darling.” A chuckle escapes him, light and effortless. A lie wrapped in silk. And yet, as they continue walking, he can’t help but steal glances at Xander along the way.
