### Scene 1: August 20th

Xander’s POV: Xander wakes on the beach. After an indescribable amount of time, of which Xander spends struggling against what might as well be an unrelenting onslaught of psychic damage, he manages to pull himself together—albeit just barely. The cognitive overload from the innumerable memories is immense, as is the accompanying emotions. A deep sense of loss, grief, and helplessness weighs heavily over him. And yet, thanks to his stubborn, steadfast nature, an almost visceral determination rises. Unsteady, he once again rises to his feet. His body moves like it has a mind of its own, walking straight to Shadowheart. She lies several feet away, unconscious. With hurried movements, he leans down and shakes her awake. Shadowheart, like always, wakes with ease. And, much to his dismay, she also speaks to him as she always does when they meet on the beach—in other words, unlike Xander, she has no recollection of having done all of this before. Despite the urge to question her on it, he leaves well enough alone for now, relieved that she's here at the very least. Agreeing to travel together and search for a cure, they set off. Xander leads, as he always had, and heads straight for Gale. In true wizard fashion, Gale is stuck inside a giant rock—a rock that is adorned with a magic rune sigil (seemingly lost in some 'magical pocket of space'). This, of course, is how Gale is *always* found after the crash. Being a magic user, a bard specifically, he uses some magic to calm the rune. Gale's hand reaches out of the portal, and Gale himself asks "for a hand" on getting out. Xander, without hesitation, pulls him out—and as Gale is pulled free, the force of it causes the two of them to fall back onto the ground. Upon standing, Gale, similar to Shadowheart, greets Xander as he always had. Again, meaning that Gale, too, has no memory of any of this. It rattles Xander, though he ruthlessly pushes the unnerving feeling aside. It's fine. As long as he can get everyone together again, keep everyone safe, it'll be fine. The silently horrifying, daunting reality he's found himself in can wait. He just needs to recruit as many of their companions as possible while the adrenaline is still running high, and avoid thinking or speaking too much in the meantime. To try and ignore the aching realization that no one remembers what they'd been through together—and worst of all, Astarion won't remember what they were to each other. They're strangers. Again. It's somehow worse now though, given that they're one-sided strangers. He gives a shake of his head and buries his internal, underlying fear. With Gale now in their party, grateful to be searching for a healer (for the tadpoles in their heads) together, Xander suggests that they make camp before carrying on. Might as well set it up now to get it over and done with. This, thankfully, doesn't take long. Once they arrive back at the crash site, he suggests splitting up to find supplies and any remaining survivors—a genuine suggestion, though calculated. Unbeknownst to Shadowheart and Gale, Astarion is on the opposite side of the crash site. And, quite frankly, Xander wants to meet him alone. So, after they agree to split off, Xander makes his way toward Astarion’s direction. Xander approaches Astarion, and Astarion says the same thing he always had; meaning, he didn't recognize or remember Xander at all. Despite himself, Xander’s hopes are crushed, and he's unwittingly grief-stricken. The intense overwhelm of everything, it's too much for him to handle—his mind buckles under the weight and just... shuts down. Emotionally/mentally shutdown and unable to endure anymore, needing a moment to just be—he turns to leave, deciding he'll come back to recruit Astarion later. 

Astarion’s POV: Astarion, however, takes this opportunity to jump him. He pulls the bard down to the ground. Astarion draws his dagger and holds it against Xander’s throat, threatening him. Astarion believes that Xander helped the mind flayers kidnap him/put a tadpole in his brain. But Astarion realizes, before he can get any accusations out, Xander is not struggling against him at all—his face is expressionless, slightly strained—and he silently, wordlessly crying. His blank eyes stare at Astarion, the tears welling up and streaming steadily down his face. Astarion is absolutely bewildered, to the nth degree. His composure falters—his expression conveying utter bewilderment. Mentally, he struggles with he's understanding what's happening. “What in the hells—” he says, more to himself than anything. He suddenly jolts, feeling a trembling touch against his arm. But rather than threatening, it's soothing—or at least attempting to be. Just as he's about to pull back, his mind lurches, visions flooding into his headspace. He feels a powerful wave of love, longing and guilt. Not his own feelings, but the feelings from this stranger—in relation to whatever this ‘vision’ is. And, most bizarrely, he sees and hears himself through the stranger's perspective, witnessing fragmented portions of different conversations.

(This is what Astarion witnesses during the tadpole mind meld):

Xander laughs softly, though whatever it was in response to is unclear. Astarion stands in front of him, bathed in early morning light. The rogue looks happy. Genuinely happy. Astarion’s beautiful features, laughter-laced and content, are somehow even more breathtaking—absolutely radiant. He folds his arms and hums, feigning contemplation. “You saved yourself,” he murmurs fondly, “I just gave you a push.”

Astarion chuckles, his voice loving and full of admiration. “You did more than that, my love. You... believed in me. Believed I was enough. Just the way I am,” he remarks as he gestures at himself, warm laughter escaping him. His crimson gaze remains on Xander as he shifts his weight, mindful for a moment. He continues, his tone dipping to something soft. “When I look at my future... anything and everything feels possible now. And I get to share it with you. As a partner. An…” he pauses. Tipping his head thoughtfully, he affirms, “...An equal.” Them, he gestures at Xander, at the area around them, his tone content and deeply grateful. “You saved me from myself, and let me walk a path where I can be free. Truly, honestly, free,” he says with a bright, hopeful smile, “This is a gift, you know. Thank you. I won't forget it.”

The vision then abruptly changes. The sight of a hazy sunset looms in the distance. It hovers low on the horizon, painting the sea below in warm hues. A quick flash of a silver sword comes into view. There’s panicked screaming somewhere behind him, too vague to make out. Vision-Xander doesn't skip a beat, pointing his sword towards himself. The sickening squelch of metal piercing flesh fills the air, competing with the sound of blood rushing and the stunned, helpless voice just over his shoulder. Just as quickly as it began, the sword drops, metal clinking like finality made audible. Vision-Xander stumbles heavily and falls off the dock. The cold water swallows him, dragging him down into its dark depths mercilessly. Just as everything begins to fade to nothingness, the Nautiloid crash site on the beach comes into view—

(The tadpole mind meld ends.)

Astarion’s POV: The connection suddenly breaks, leaving Astarion reeling. With his eyes closed and head in his free hand, he tries to comprehend what he just saw. His grip on Xander falters, though Xander doesn't move. Astarion angrily grumbles out, “What—what was that?! What trick are you trying to pull, you wretch—” Upon opening his eyes he stops, realizing the strange man below him hasn't moved, and his expression is no longer unsettlingly blank—he's now looking at him devastated, tears welling up alarmingly. 

Xander’s POV: Xander tries to speak. “This—” his voice breaks, “this can't be real—” His attempted whisper comes out broken and uneven, laced with disbelief. He covers his face with his hands as the tears start streaming out.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion, baffled, draws back slightly. The unexpected emotional reaction made him incredibly uncomfortable. In an attempt to avoid the unsettling feeling, and to reassert control, he snaps harshly, “Enough! What are you playing at?!”

Xander’s POV: Xander shakes his head once. “I'm not!—We're—” he chokes out, voice muffled by his hands, “—we're infected!” He blurts out. 

Astarion’s POV: Panic rises, quick and furious. He firmly grabs Xander’s shoulder, eyes narrowing. “Stop crying and explain yourself! What are we infected with? What did you do to me?!” he demands, voice urgent and frustrated. 

Xander’s POV: Xander removes his hands, exposing his wet, tear stained face. “I didn't! The mind flayers—on the Nautiloid—” he frantically tries to explain, eyes wide and terrified. He tries to fight the urge to cry, though, not very successfully—in hopes of expressing himself more clearly. Internally, the fear of Astarion’s mistrust—and the horrifying realization of him not remembering—wrestles incessantly. “We'll—it'll turn us into one!”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion narrows his eyes and tightens his grip on him. “A mind flayer?!” he hisses in response. Xander numbly nods, confirming it. Then, hesitantly, he pulls back and sits on his heels. He mutters in bitter disbelief, “Of course it'll turn me into a monster.” As Xander begins to sit up, Astarion glances at him cautiously, readying to strike if needed. Xander’s features are still contorted in a mixture of grief and pain, the bard hunching over, face in trembling hands. He watches the man warily. “You seem to know what's going on. Do you know how long we have? Is there a way to control these—these 'worms'?”

Xander’s POV: Xander peeks up at him, vaguely surprised—but then looks away, as if the sight of Astarion hurts him. “We…” he starts, voice strained, “I don't... I don't know.” He hesitantly whispers, second guessing himself. Glancing back at Astarion, his tearful eyes search and study him, appearing hopeful, yet anxious. “Do you want to... join me? To find a cure?... Or a way to control them?” His voice is uneven and raspy, tentatively asking.

Astarion’s POV: Squinting in response, Astarion carefully observes the bard, uncertain. After a moment, his gaze briefly glances aside, considering his options. Dealing with this alone would be insanely daunting. But traveling with someone, relying on someone—especially someone who seems... troubled, to put it lightly—is equally daunting. Both options unease him. Closing his eyes, he sighs and sets his sight on Xander again. “...Fine. I'll join you.” The bard glances at him, looking taken aback but relieved. Like slipping on an old glove, he turns on the charm, his practiced mask back in place. He stands and gives a flamboyant flourish as he probably introduces himself. “But where are my manners? My name's Astarion.”

Xander’s POV: Xander nods politely in response, struggling to hold Astarion’s gaze. Wordlessly, he hands the rogue his map. He then explains in a quick and quiet voice, “Here. I marked our camp. Gale and Shadowheart are there—they're fine, don't worry. I'll be there in a bit.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion quirks a brow, unsure what to make of the bard’s strange behavior. Cautiously he takes the map, deciding to resign himself to keeping an eye on the man. “Very well, then,” he replies simply, then stalks off toward their camp. 

Xander’s POV: As soon as Xander sees Astarion turn around the corner up ahead, the full weight of everything hits him harder than anything he's ever felt. He buckles under the mental and emotional weight, his body physically giving way. The tears and sobs start up with fierce intensity. So much so, his sobs quickly raise in volume, the mind-numbing grief and emotional pain drowning him from the inside. The grief-stricken, heart-wrenching cries loudly echo around the area. Hours pass. Xander oscillates between the uncontrollable sobbing and brief moments of silent shock. Eventually, he arrives at camp looking like a broken, lifeless mess. It's now dusk. Without a word he heads to bed and attempts to rest for the night—a task that proves to be difficult. He lies awake for an indiscernible amount of time, the exhaustion of breaking down for hours on end catching up to him. It pulls him into a restless, nightmarish sleep, causing him to wake periodically throughout the night. Just... lovely.
