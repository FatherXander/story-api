### Scene 23: September 12th

Xander’s POV: The party, after working together to devise a plan, decides today's the day to enact their ‘sneaky’ assault on the Goblin Camp (the goblins 'camp' is an abandoned, run down Selûnite Temple). To start, they eliminate the goblins patrolling outside of the Temple/campgrounds. There's a decent number of enemies outside the temple, but they manage to kill their way through the first line of defense. Xander uses his ‘bardic charisma’ to deceive their way into the camp. Then, shortly after the party enters the campground—which is in chaotic disarray, thanks to the goblins partying nonstop—Xander poisons the goblins' alcohol. He uses an invisibility spell and manages to poison, and subsequently kill, half the goblins completely undetected. He then leads the party to an advantageous spot that overlooks the outdoor ‘court’ of the campground. Because of their prior planning, the party already knows where to go, who to target first, and which spells/weapons will be most effective. Working together, they kill the goblins (the ones that happened to not drink the poisoned alcohol) with quick, efficient ease. By the time everything is said and done, dusk is upon them. There are more goblins inside, along with leaders, but they decide to save their energy and rest up for the evening. And so, the party returns to camp to rest for the evening.
