### Scene 17: September 5th

Xander’s POV: The party makes their way into the Underdark. Xander utilizes his memories of the loops to navigate them through the initial area with ease, and uses his bard skills to persuade/deceive others to gain access to places (mainly Grymforge) and to help the party/neutral parties in the Underdark (that the party will benefit from in the long run).
