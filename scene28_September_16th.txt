### Scene 28: September 16th

Astarion’s POV: Astarion closes the book on his lap, sets it aside, and sighs. The atmosphere in camp is uncharacteristically subdued—fatigue, no doubt. The usual hum of idle chatter, clinking gear, and suppressed laughter is absent tonight. Most of the companions are tucked away in tents or indulging in quiet pastimes, leaving the camp unusually hushed. There’s something about tonight—perhaps it’s the lingering bloodlust of Creche Y'llek still buzzing beneath his skin, or perhaps it's him—Xander. That damn bard. He watches from across the campfire as Xander continues to scribble away in a book. Always writing. Always recording, as if afraid the present will be ripped away again. He watches the bard from a distance—and for longer than he cares to admit. Every minute, another excuse not to rise. Not to go. Not to ask. But the question has been clawing at his throat all evening. What were we to each other, in those other timelines? What memories does Xander have of me? What does Xander see when he looks at me—truly looks at me? The visions, the one-sided familiarity, the way Xander looks at him with an ache he's never been on the receiving end of, ever—it’s maddening. It’s unfair. With an imperceptible sigh, he stands. Quiet, smooth, controlled—crossing the space between them like a phantom. He stops just as the firelight bathes his form. “Darling,” he begins—too casual, too practiced. He tilts his head, eyes catching the fire’s reflection like rubies. “A question, if you’ll indulge me.” Xander looks up at him, expectant and patient, an unspoken que to continue. “I’ve been thinking…” he says, voice deceptively light, “You’ve said we’ve done this before. Loops, timelines, fate having its endless joke at our expense. And if I recall,” he speaks while stepping closer, his gaze sharpening, “you told me a few weeks ago… that you were afraid of losing me.” He pauses. It's not a pause of hesitation—it's one of calculation. His voice softens, broaching the question in a smooth, almost flippant tone. “So, in those other versions of this ridiculous little tale… what were we?” He slowly lowers, resting an arm across his knee, his crimson eyes searching Xander’s face. “Were we just fellow sufferers in a long, looping tragedy?” He leans in, just barely, and drops his voice to a whisper. “Or was I… something more to you?” He smiles faintly, but there's no mockery in it. No playful tease. Just the sharp edge of intrigue he can no longer ignore.

Xander’s POV: Xander blinks at Astarion, taken aback by the question. Without breaking eye contact, he closes his journal and sets aside like an afterthought. He murmurs with a breathy chuckle, “I… hm. What a question to ask. Well, questions, more accurately.” Shifting to fully face Astarion, he considers the rogue for a moment, his gaze thoughtful as it searches in turn. Then, with a soft hum, he continues. “To put it very simply—and to save you from a night's worth of explaining—we were together,” he says, his voice low, candid, but not unkind, “Together in the romantic sense of the word. Friends, lovers, partners. Equals.” He pauses and gestures at Astarion. “So, yes, you were something more to me. You are something more to me, and you have been this entire time.” His words are unguarded, unabashed and unapologetic in their inherent openness. “I consider you the love of my life. Or would it be lives?” He offers a faint smile and his voice lowers, just a touch. “…Did that answer your question, dear?”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion doesn’t move. Not for a long moment. He simply watches. He watches as Xander’s words settle between them like embers from the fire—quiet, flickering, undeniable. The bard hadn’t hesitated. Not once. No evasion. No mockery. No flinching away from the intimacy of it. "You were something more to me. You are something more to me. You have been this entire time." It hits harder than he expects. And that’s infuriating. Because wasn’t this the entire point of tonight? To hear it from those lips? To dig into the mystery like a dagger, to carve out the truth of what Xander sees when he looks at him? And now that it’s here—this answer, bare and given freely—he can barely breathe around it. He is not used to being chosen. Desired, yes. Pursued, absolutely. But this... this is something far worse. Or better. Gods, he doesn’t even know anymore. "Together," Xander had said. Lovers. Partners. Equals. Equals. What a damning, beautiful word. He swallows hard. It’s imperceptible, nearly. Just a shift in the way his throat tightens beneath a veneer of perfect stillness. His expression remains composed, every muscle held in that calculated, feline stillness he’s so accustomed to. But his mind—his mind reels. Because Xander has always been too generous. Too gentle in ways that make his skin crawl and undead heart jump all at once. From the moment they met, the bard looked at him with something too much like grief. As if mourning him in advance. As if loving him wasn’t an accident, but an inevitability. He ought to be wary. He should play coy. Say something biting, laced in sarcasm, let it roll off his tongue like poisoned honey. But he doesn’t. Instead, he watches the man before him—this tired, too-knowing bard with eyes full of tragic affection—and something in him softens. Not in surrender, no, never that. But something yields, just slightly, to the gravity of it. “…Lives,” he echoes softly, his voice almost too quiet to be heard above the crackling fire. “Plural, you say. How wonderfully absurd.” His gaze drops to the journal Xander set aside, lingering there for a heartbeat before flicking back up. That damn book. Always writing, always preserving. As if afraid memory itself is a battlefield. He shifts just slightly closer, still crouched beside him, resting his elbow on his knee now. His tone turns lightly sardonic, but his eyes betray him—still searching, still hungry for something not even he can name. “And you remember all of it, do you?” he murmurs, voice like silk drawn over steel. “Every tender moment, every tragedy... every fresh start.” A pause. Then, more quietly, “And yet you’re still here.” It’s not accusatory. It’s astonished. As if he can’t quite believe it. And truth be told—he can’t. No one stays after they see the worst of him. Not for long. Not really. They flinch, they run, or worse—they try to fix him. But Xander? Xander has bled and burned and died, and he still looks at him like he’s something worth cherishing. That’s the most terrifying thing of all. Finally, Astarion’s lips curve—not into a smirk, not into a grin, but something quiet. Something almost... reverent. “Well then,” he breathes, crimson gaze steady, “I suppose I owe you an apology.” He tilts his head, the firelight dancing in his eyes. “For assuming that whatever this is... was a game I was winning.” A beat. His smile sharpens, glinting with mischief—but not cruelty. “You know, darling… it’s rather unsettling to find myself outmaneuvered by a bard.” But there’s no heat behind it. Only affection. Uneasy, reluctant, unspoken—but real. The kind that roots itself before you can name it. He lowers his gaze to the journal once more, then back to Xander. “And yes,” he says, gentler now, with a hint of reluctant vulnerability, “that did answer my question.” He doesn’t say thank you. But maybe, for once, he doesn’t have to.
