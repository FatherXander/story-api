### Scene 9: August 28th

Xander’s POV: As the early evening passes, the companions begin to retire for the night. All but Xander and Astarion, of course. The camp is quiet, the sound of crackling firewood filling the air, as shadows dance across the surrounding tents. Xander sits atop his bedding at the campfire alone, his journal balanced on his knees. He’s scribbling something, a new habit he's picked up in the last few days. With the camp at rest, the companions in their respective tents, there's a rare moment of stillness that settles in the nighttime air.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion, from a distance, has been watching. His red eyes flicker in the glow of the fire, and he can't help the slight smirk that creeps across his lips. There’s an element of nerves mingling with anticipation—this is a night of firsts, a chance to finally step into something unknown, unbound by Cazador’s rules. He quietly crosses the camp, making his presence known only when he’s just a few feet away. “Well, well, darling, it seems you're always hard at work,” he purrs softly, his tone teasing. He steps closer until he’s standing beside Xander, glancing down at the journal. “Sketching your latest conquests, perhaps?” he chuckles, a sly smile playing on his lips. “Or maybe... planning something more scandalous?”

Xander’s POV: Xander’s sight is pulled from what he was busying himself with, a smile creeping up on his features. He glances up at Astarion and feigns an innocent expression. “Nothing of the sort, my dear,” he replies in an unassuming tone. His smile gains a sly appearance, mirroring the one Astarion’s lips. “I'm simply making notes on how much I adore you, of course.” Without breaking eye-contact, he sets his journal aside and shifts his seated position slightly—just enough to face Astarion more directly. He looks up at the rogue with an underlying awareness behind his eyes. “But... we'll save such disarming sentimentalities for another time, hm?” he suggests with a quirk of his brow. Then, offering Astarion a playful smile, he gestures in front of himself, “With that said—why not join me down here? You can't bite me from up there, you know.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion eels something dark and eager coil in his gut. "You can't bite me from up there, you know." Oh, darling—that’s all the permission he needs. A low, delighted chuckle escapes him, honey-smooth and predatory. The way his eyes glitter in the firelight borders on indecent. That tension—so thick just moments ago—melts into something far more familiar. And completely, utterly intoxicating. No terror, no shame. Just desire and control and the beautiful, unspoken contract of indulgence. It’s practically a gift wrapped in unearned trust. It is a gift, truly. A gift he won't ever forget. He grins—wide, wolfish, all teeth and gleam. “Oh, darling,” he purrs, voice like velvet draped in sin, “when you put it like that…” He shifts, knees brushing the ground as he hovers over Xander. One hand finds purchase near Xander’s shoulder, balancing himself, while the other brushes the bard’s jaw—just lightly, just enough to tilt his face and gain more access. Warmth pulses beneath his palm as he cradles the back of Xander’s neck, cool fingers threading into obsidian strands. He doesn't question Xander. Doesn’t warn. Because this isn’t about care or connection. This is about freedom. This is about survival. He will take what he needs—and if he can leave this bard just a little more tangled in his web? All the better. Let Xander taste guilt and offer kindness. Let Xander give and give and give. He will happily take everything. Swift and sharp and without hesitation, he sinks his fangs into that tempting neck. A moan curls low in his throat as blood—fresh, warm blood, rich with life—rushes across his tongue. It's indescribable. Ecstasy and fire, power and defiance. It’s the first act of rebellion he's ever enjoyed. No Cazador. No rules. Just the taste of freedom, intoxicating and overwhelmed. So very overwhelming.

Xander’s POV: Xander gasps as soon as Astarion’s fangs break skin, piercing his neck like shards of ice. His back arches, hands curled into fists, legs reactively drawing up. It feels intense. The pull of his blood flowing into Astarion’s, a sensation that's steady and almost intimate, is insanely ravenous. Unchecked and unfiltered, like a dam has broken and given way during a monstrous flood. He barely has a moment to relax into it—which he does, technically—before that moan escapes Astarion’s throat. He can feel it just as much as he can hear it. Gods. If blood loss doesn't kill him, that most certainly will. He exhales, his breathing straining with restraint, trembling and shallow. Without conscious intent, his hands find purchase on Astarion’s back, fingers curling into the rogue’s clothing with thoughtless familiarity. He tries to keep his body still, but as the blood loss settles in—far too quickly and mercilessly. A gentle numbness spreads throughout his body and he begins losing himself. Soft sounds and weak groans slip past his lips in spite of himself, but he hardly notices. And doesn't particularly care, either. He vaguely feels how erratically his heart is racing—something that proves to accelerate the draining of blood. As the strange, almost euphoric haze of loss clouds his mind, he sighs contently, his hands tightening against Astarion’s back in a subconscious effort to pull him closer.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion feeds. Gods, he feeds—like a man starved, like a beast unchained. As Xander’s blood continues to travel along his tongue and down his throat, it’s as though centuries of torment melt away into molten ecstasy. Rich, hot, alive—nothing like the fetid rot of rats or the stale scrape of insects. This is divine. This is what it was meant to be. He shudders violently, groaning low into the curve of Xander’s neck, as if he might come undone right then and there. He doesn’t register the hands on his back until they tighten—fingertips pressing into the fabric of his shirt, clinging. Not pushing away. Pulling closer. And that—that damnable trust—nearly drives him mad. Because this is not supposed to be like this. It’s not supposed to feel like a sin and salvation both. He came here to take, to consume, to see if the commandment carved into his spine could be broken. He didn’t come here for this warmth pooling beneath his ribs, or for the way Xander's scent is already imprinted in his mind like a lover’s perfume. He didn’t come here to feel seen. But now? Now he can't stop. Every swallow burns sweet and bright, a rebellion made real. He moans again, this time softer, drawn-out. It’s almost pathetic, how deeply he sinks into the feeling, his body flush against Xander's now. His hand cradles the bard’s head possessively—What are you doing, fool?—but the other claws into the ground beside them, anchoring him, barely keeping him from losing control entirely. It’s too much. It’s too good. Every heartbeat he feels against his lips tells him he’s still drinking, too much, far too much—but gods, how can he stop? He’s waited so long. Centuries. The desperate, feral part of him screams—More. Take more. Never let go. And honestly? That part of him seems to know best, doesn't it? There's no reason to fight his nature. This is what he is, what he was made to be. An apathetic vampire that takes everything without a second thought. And now? Well, he's an apathetic vampire getting exactly what he wants. Blood. Power. Control.

Xander’s POV: Xander’s ability to form a single coherent thought is blissfully lost. Time, stress, pain—all of it melts away before he can comprehend its absence. All that's left is vague physical sensations and a sense of peace that feels gracious. He leans into Astarion, losing himself in him. The pressure of Astarion’s body may anchor him physically, but it does little to ground him in the figuratively. Still, his arms wrap around the rogue as if moving on their accord, the movement slow and lethargic. His eyes slip shut with a deep sigh. The sounds that leave Astarion—low groans, lingering moans—reverberate on his neck and echo distantly in his mind, coaxing him to fall further into this. Not that he needs any coaxing. He wants this. He'd hand over everything if it meant holding onto this. It feels so... nice. So good. For once, his mind is silent. A quiet that he shouldn't have—a sort of mercy that feels magnanimous, but one that he craves all the same. And the more he lets go, the more he gives, the more that craving is fed. His breathing slows to a calming crawl—still unsteady and shallow, but calm—in tandem with his declining heart rate. This, of course, isn't apparent to him. He's too blissed-out to notice. Or care. Instead, a gentle hum rumbles out of him, his hands running up and down Astarion’s back thoughtlessly.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion doesn’t feel it at first. The blood, yes—gods, yes, the blood he feels. Rich and heady, it flows like a long-denied elixir down his throat, warming every frozen inch of him. But the heartbeat—it’s slowing. His body is too caught up in the ecstasy to notice until it’s nearly stopped. And when he does notice? It’s almost annoying. He freezes mid-drink, the euphoric fog peeling back just enough to reveal the silence underneath. No pulse. No breathing. No trembling. Just... stillness. The warmth is still there in his mouth, but the source lies cold beneath him. The arms once gripping him are limp now, useless. Xander’s dead. He killed him, drained every last drop of blood from the bard’s body… Oops. He exhales softly, licking his lips as he lifts his head. His eyes drift down, unbothered, mildly curious. “Well. That was almost sweet, wasn’t it?” he remarks, flat and sarcastic, as he sits back on his heels. He studies Xander’s lifeless body for a moment longer, tilting his head. There’s no pang of guilt. No stab of regret. Just a mild irritation. With theatrical exasperation, he mutters to himself, “One bite. That was all I needed. Just a taste. But no—of course you had to be so delicious.” He glances around camp. Still quiet. Perfect. A moment passes. Then two. He frowns slightly, watching the body like it might move again. A dark chuckle rises up and out of him. “Honestly, if you’re going to swoon to death from one little feeding, perhaps you weren’t quite as capable as you liked to pretend, darling.” Still, something nags at him—not morality, of course, never that. Just the faintest sense of... missed opportunity. The kind of nuisance that comes when a useful tool breaks too early. He liked Xander. Or rather—Xander was interesting. Strange. And generous to a fault. Far too generous, apparently. “Well,” he says to the bard’s corpse with an exaggerated sigh, “rest in peace, my sweet idiot. At least you died doing something useful. Feeding me.” He reaches out, brushing back a lock of Xander’s midnight hair, gaze unreadable. Then he stands, smooth and graceful, wiping the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand. His stomach is full, his strength returned. The hunger... gone. And there is no punishment. No burning pain, no controlling voice. No Cazador. Only silence. Freedom. He smiles, confident and self-satisfied. And with that, he turns away, humming faintly as he strides off toward the shadows of camp, unapologetic as ever. After all, what’s one dead bard to him? He now knows that Cazador, while still a horrifying threat, can't control him as long as he has this tadpole in his head. And that—that's all that matters to him.
