### Scene 8: August 27th

Xander’s POV: With the evening in full swing, Xander approaches Astarion, giving the rogue a curious once over. His eyes search Astarion’s features carefully. He can't quite hide how his expression gives away his desire to ask something. “I've been meaning to ask you... the other night when I woke up and—well... grabbed you without warning, unfortunately—you were going to bite me, weren't you?” he asks, candid, his tone genuine and void of accusation. “I'm not upset by any means, but I am curious.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion arches a brow. “Bite you?” he echoes, his voice dripping with playful sarcasm. “Oh, darling, you flatter yourself.” His lips curl into a small, sharp smile, but there's a fleeting moment where his gaze flickers with something else—uncertainty, perhaps. Not that he'd ever admit it. “I was merely... inspecting the menu, as it were.” He pauses, eyes darting briefly before meeting Xander again, this time with a more guarded expression. “But if I had really wanted to,” his voice lowers, and a hint of seriousness creeps in, “you’d never have known.” He crosses his arms, shifting his weight slightly as he watches Xander carefully, trying to gauge the bard’s reaction.

Xander’s POV: Returning the fixed stare, Xander straightens and hums in mock consideration. “I would've never known?” Closing his eyes, he taps his finger on his chin in faux consideration. “I'm certain you've done the same thing, many times before…” he opens his eyes and gives Astarion a playful look, “Every time, in fact—in our previous resets, I mean. And wouldn't you know… I happened to catch you in the act every time, my dear.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s smirk falters for just a heartbeat. He recovers quickly, his tone carrying its usual playful sharpness. “My, you must be quite the expert on my habits. Though, if the thought of me sinking my teeth into you excites you,” he leans in just a touch, his voice low and smooth, “Who am I to deny you such fantasies?” He chuckles darkly, though his eyes flicker with a hint of wariness. “Tell me, how exactly did you catch me in the act every time? You must have quite the trick up your sleeve.” His eyes narrow slightly as he watches Xander, probing for answers. “And I must admit... I’m curious what you think you know.”

Xander’s POV: Xander hums softly, a small smile still adorning his features. “Ah, fantasies? Well, that's one way of looking at it,” he teases lightly, laughter punctuating his words. Glancing aside and sighing in feigned disappointment, he replies, “No trick, I'm afraid. I got lucky and woke up every time.” He glances back at Astarion and his expression softens a touch. “That's how I found out you were a vampire, actually,” he remarks, then pauses. With a quiet, self-deprecating laugh, he adds, “But it played out differently in the ‘loops’ compared to the other night.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion arches a brow, his lips curling into a small, sharp smirk. “So, it seems you are quite the expert.” His voice carries a playful edge, but the smirk doesn’t reach his eyes. There’s a flicker of unease, quickly masked by his usual mockery. “You’ve caught me, then. I was going to bite you,” he concedes, deceptively light. He pauses, watching Xander carefully, his expression tightening slightly. “What now, darling? Will you run off to the others, expose the poor little vampire’s secret?” His voice is smooth as ever, but there’s a glint of something deeper—an edge of vulnerability he can't quite hide. “Now that you know the truth, what does that mean to you? Hmm?” The challenge in his eyes is sharp, as if he’s daring Xander to reject him or prove him wrong.

Xander’s POV: Despite himself, Xander laughs, soft and quiet. He raises his eyebrows and gives Astarion a genuinely curious look. “'What does it mean to me'?” he repeats, then shakes his head slightly and continues, “I mean, that's a small part of who you are. It doesn't detract from how I view you or anything. Besides, we all have our own ‘darkness,’ no?” He glances around the camp, at the other companions, almost pointedly. His gaze flickers back to Astarion, meeting the rogue’s gaze with ease. “And no, I'm not about to go running around gossiping,” he affirms with a disbelieving laugh, “That's not my secret to tell, after all.” Crossing his arms, voice carrying a mock seriousness tone, he adds, “Strange, isn't it? It's almost as if I'm not a deplorable bastard.” His smile grows just a little more. “Almost.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion gives a soft, incredulous chuckle, his eyes narrowing. Placing a hand on his hip, he studies Xander more closely. “Oh, almost a bastard, you say?” he murmurs, his voice still light, but there’s a hint of something deeper beneath it—an edge of curiosity mixed with wariness. “How wonderfully complicated you make it sound, darling.” He pauses for a moment, his gaze flickering with amusement. Then, scoffing quietly, he remarks, “You don’t frighten easily, do you? Most people would have run off screaming by now, but here you are, treating my… vampiric nature as just another quirk.” He tilts his head, his smirk widening. “I suppose I should be flattered.”

Xander’s POV: Soft laughter filters out of Xander in response. “I didn't realize being an 'almost bastard' was considered 'wonderfully complicated',” he teases, his gaze dancing with lighthearted amusement. “But I'll take that, and your assumption of me ‘not scaring easily,’ as a compliment. How terribly generous of you.” Pausing for a beat, he tips his head thoughtfully. “Your assumptions are correct, though. I don't frighten easily. In fact…” he leans in a fraction, his gaze unflinching—and holding a subtle warmth behind it, “You couldn't scare me if you tried, my dear.” A grin creeps up on his face, causing his eyes and features to soften considerably. His voice lowers, flirtation and genuine interest wrapping around his whisper. “But I know you'll try anyway. Why not make it a date, hm? I do rather enjoy your company.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s eyes widen briefly, but it's fleeting. Nearly imperceptible. He quickly replaces it with a smooth, sly smile that barely hides the slight shock he feels. Xander’s easy confidence, that playful but affectionate challenge, catches him off guard. It unnerves him—but just a little. “Well, aren’t you the bold one?” he drawls, voice laced with a teasing edge. Arching a brow, his smirk tugs at the corners of his mouth, “A date, you say? And here I thought you’d at least try to play hard to get. How terribly disappointing.” The mock disappointment in his voice is clear. It's all a part of the game. It's always a game—charm, disarm, manipulate. Taking a step closer to Xander, he leans in slightly to match the bard’s proximity. His smile remains sharp and knowing, though his eyes briefly flicker with something more calculated. “Very well then, darling. Let’s make it a date,” he purrs, dripping with a practiced sultry tone. “We'll see if a dangerous companion such as myself will make for pleasant company, darling.”

Xander’s POV: Xander’s eyes gleam with amusement as he listens to Astarion respond, quiet laughter trickling out all the while. “Really? Why, you are truly generous, aren't you?” he murmurs, teasing, an underlying fondness weaving through his words, “Although... dangerous or not, you happen to be my favorite companion.” With a flourish of his hand, he gestures at Astarion, and confirms, “I'll see your fine, sharp self tomorrow evening, then.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion is taken aback by Xander’s forthrightness, even as he maintains a playful exterior. It’s unnerving in a way, the lack of fear or hesitation in Xander’s eyes. Gods, the bard is objectively foolish—trusting him, of all people. The playfulness in his expression remains, though he is internally cautious. “Generous indeed,” he replies lightly, but his eyes pierce into the bard. He's trying to read Xander, to peer behind the warmth and confidence to see something vulnerable—to determine if he can use this to his advantage. He then nods, offering a knowing smile, and adds, “Tomorrow evening it is. I’ll be sure to sharpen my edges, just for you.”
