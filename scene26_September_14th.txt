### Scene 26: September 14th

Xander’s POV: The party enters the Mountain Pass area. They come across a “Society of Brilliance” member on the road toward the Githyanki Creche. They stop to speak to her, and she's incredibly demeaning towards the Githyanki people. She wanted to steal one of their eggs—as in, one of their children—for research purposes. Lae-zel is obviously pissed off by the woman's suggestion, just as Xander is. This woman had the audacity to not only shit-talk the Githyanki, try to steal a child of theirs, and degrade Lae-zel to her face—but also had the nerve to ask the party to get the egg for her. So. Naturally, she had to die. She had some amazing armor that went straight to Astarion. It's a must have for rogue classes as it heightens their dexterity. And, while Astarion looks amazing in literally everything, he looks extra incredible in this armor. An extra powerful and extra hot Astarion? What a lethal combination—in the best way.
