### Scene 21: September 10th

Xander’s POV: The party is, again, busy in the Underdark. Just as they discussed yesterday, the party returns to the Myconid colony. Xander informs the leader, Spaw, of the Duergar’s death. Spaw, having been melancholic, has a change of tune when the news is delivered. Thankful for the party’s help, Spaw bestows them with a temporary ‘spore blessing’. This blessing sharpens the party’s minds while also giving them a sense of bliss. Along with this, Spaw tells them that there’s a cave within the colony that holds some invaluable treasure inside. Spaw, using some Myconid plant magic, makes the cave accessible to the party. Before they head to the cave, Xander speaks to Spaw once more, asking if there’s anyone else the colony is looking to seek revenge against (Xander recalls Spaw requesting their help in the loops with killing a drow named Nere, the supposed mastermind behind the colony’s slaughter, and decides to take the initiative). Sure enough, Spaw confirms that there is someone else that they seek to have killed for their cruelty. Spaw mentions Nere, explains what Xander already knows (though Xander doesn’t interrupt or assume anything, instead listening to Spaw like he’s learning the information for the first time), and requests that Nere’s head be brought back as proof of the drow’s death. Xander agrees to help. The party crosses the short distance to the cave and collects the rewards inside (a magically enhanced Hood of Menzoberranzan, which provides the wearer with increased stealth and the ability to cast invisibility, a piece of a powerful, magically enhanced weapon (there’s three piece overall they have to collect, one of which they retrieved off of the crazed wizard’s corpse yesterday), and a book that provides information on a ‘guardian’ within Grymforge). With the reward gathered, the party briefly travels back to the surface. They go to the weapon smith’s workshop in Blight Village, Sussar bark, weapon blueprints, and a sickle in hand. Using the bellows to fire up the furnace in the smith’s workshop, the sickle and Sussar bark and carefully combined. Given the inherent magical properties of the Sussar tree (Sussar trees bloom flowers that nullify magic of any user of creature when within a certain proximity to the flower), the sickle is now magically enhanced. Upon a success hit with the sickle, any person, creature, or object will have the Silence spell effect for a short duration of time. This mean that anything that casts magic will be unable to until the Silence effect wears off. It’s very useful when fighting against magic users (or creatures). Now that they’ve secured the Sussar weapon, the party returns to the Underdark. Xander leads the party to a wizard’s tower, located near the beach they were at yesterday. Protected by two Arcane Turrets (which will lock onto anyone that walks onto the property, and if in view of the turrets, will be shot at with magic), the party hides just outside of the Arcane Turrets’ ‘line of sight’. With a little illusionary magic and sneaking, Gale and Wyll fry the Arcane Turrets with lightning spells (one of the only spells these turrets are vulnerable to). This tall wizard’s tower is a blend of magic and machinery. Xander explains that there’s an elevator they can use to get from floor to floor, so it’ll be best if they use Feather Fall, jump way down to the bottom floor of the tower (they’re currently at ‘main floor level,’ just outside the front door), and break in through the back door. Upon getting down there, they find a small Sussar tree growing in the backyard (the owner, who seems to have mysteriously disappeared some time ago, also apparently indulged in gardening). Taking one of the Sussar flowers, Xander leads them to the back door. Astarion picks the lock and the party enters. Xander wastes no time. He immediately walks over to the elevator and inserts the Sussar flower. The elevator, along with the whole tower, spring to life. Magica blue flames ignite throughout the tower, providing a glowing light that resembles the glow of a Sussar tree. And, on the main floor, two Arcane Turrets (that they would’ve had to deal with like the ones outside the tower) shut down. The structure creeks and groans, sounding as if it’ll get up and walk away (according to those living in the Underdark, the tower does have the ‘tendency’ to just… move). At the moment, it stays put. Using the elevator to get from floor to floor, the party loots the place, top to bottom. There’s magic items, books, and sentimental items chaotically scattered about everywhere. Lots of poetry and theatre stuff specifically. As they search around and gather items, Xander and Gale talk amongst themselves. Gale remarks that the tower reminds him of studying at Blackstaff Academy. Xander, despite being almost hundred percent certain of what Gale is going to recount (damn loop memories spoil everything), shows genuine interest and asks Gale to elaborate. He continues to gather books off of old dusty shelves as Gale speaks, yet his attention is focused on Gale while the wizard speaks. He listens to with easy, fond attentiveness, laughing in response to Gale’s laughter. Just wholesome bonding, really. Everyone continues on, moving further up the tower, one floor at a time. Aside from Xander’s sticky fingers finding everything and anything of value, he also searches for (and subsequently reads) any poetry or theatrical screen plays that he can find. Finally, the reach the very top of the tower. There’s no roof, and the space is rather bare. Well, other than the automatons that are just hanging out. As the elevator stops, a large automaton steps toward the party, mechanical parts rumbling and clinking softly. It’s taller than all of them, by at least a foot or more. Xander smiles at it, his delight thinly veiled. The automaton, Bernard, then speaks. Its voice is soothing in tone and cadence, almost melodic, but its voice carries an unnatural, slightly eerie distortion and echo. “New sounds through damp and dark oppression break. Is it the foe, that foul, contemptuous heel?” Bernard questions them, its words and speech a direct copy of the poetry and theatrical scripts that Xander was reading. Gale gives Bernard a once over and sighs, remarking on enjoying poetry but thinks having an automaton that exclusively speaks and follows instruction in such a manner to be ‘self-indulgent.’ Xander huffs a laugh under his breath, murmuring something along the lines of “I’ll be shamelessly self-indulgent in a second.” Then, quickly clearing his throat, Xander replies to Bernard in a confident tone that matches Bernard’s rather dramatic pattern. “The silence stretches on; I'm all alone. Please, can I hold your hands, for just a while?” A grin breaks across his features despite himself, laughter-laced and playfully self-deprecating. He could’ve said a different line, but this one? It’s funny. And sweet, in a strange, almost sad way. Bernard steps forward, that unnatural yet soothing voice ringing out as a praising coo in response. “Of course, my love. Don’t be afraid, sweet girl,” Bernard says, its metal, lattice-like arms wrapping around Xander’s frame. It holds Xander strangely, its arms too low and too tight. Clearly, Bernard was programmed to hold someone much shorter and smaller than Xander (damn big ass bard, too tall and built for no good reason). Bernard maintains the just long enough to say, “Remember… you are loved, Lenore. So much. You’re doing great. And everyone will be so proud of you. As I already am.” Barnard’s arms stutter as its internal mechanisms work to release Xander from the hug. Xander chuckles, good-natured as always, and nods at the automaton. Some cheeky retort sits on his tongue, ready to come out, but ultimately never leaves him. His smile settles as if he’s recalling something that spoils the mood. Forcing the smile back on his lips, Xander adopts a deceptively sincere tone. To the party, it’s obvious he’s lying. The reasoning, however, isn’t obvious. “Your master… Lenore…” the name rolls off his uneasily, clearly unpracticed, “she left to see Myrna for an extended period of time. Lenore requested that I relocate you and the other automatons to the basement for the time being.” Xander gestures at the elevator platform, eyes watching Bernard expectantly. Bernard complies, giving a nod in response. Bernard and the handful on automatons manage to fit on the elevator, leaving just enough room for one more person. Turning to the party, Xander says, “I’ll run these guys to the basement really quick. The elevator can go directly down to the floor. Then, I’ll be right back. It’ll take two minutes at most.” He gets onto the elevator and shoot a thumbs up, presses the ‘descend’ button with his boot, and the elevator teleports to the bottom of the tower. A couple minutes later, the elevator returns with Xander alone. With the weird looks from some of the party, he explains, “I happened to remember that, in the loops, in our future, Bernard was stolen by Ketheric Thorm’s army for research purposes. Ketheric is one of the many poor bastards we’ll have to kill, by the way.” He shifts his weight and folds his arms. “Anyway. I recall finding Bernard’s head in the Steel Watch Foundry, down in Baldur’s Gate Lower City.” He pauses and laughs, shaking his head to himself. “I know Barnard is literally an automaton, but… he’s cool shit. So, there you have it. I’m just being sentimental about robots and such.” With a laugh and shrug, he turns his attention to something he’s been eagerly waiting for. Which is… a wooden stool. At least, it is at first glance. Picking up the stool, he lifts it over his head, and abruptly throws it on the ground. It breaks apart with a sudden, splintering sound. “Perfect,” he practically purrs under his breath, all unabashed excitement. He retrieves one of the stool’s legs, now looking like a wooden club that’d make for an excellent weapon. “Hell yeah, let’s go! I’ll be able to carry fucking everything now,” he rambles to himself, handling the club like its simply an extension of his body. This club (well, originally a leg for a stool) isn’t just a conveniently shaped piece of wood. In a wizard’s tower, some things are never quite that simple. No, no. This club is, obviously, magically enhanced. Specifically, it’s enhanced with Hill Giant Strength and bestows its wielder with a substantial strength increase. It doesn’t change the wielder’s appearance (so Xander still looks the same physically even though his strength has more than doubled), and the effect is only temporary. As soon as the wielder drops or retires the club (so, when Xander goes to bed at night, he no longer has excessively high strength), the effect is lost. When they pick it back upon again, the insane strength returns. After being a nerd about the magic club and automatons, they party exists the tower and departs for camp. The evening feels lighter than usual, somehow not quite as dim. A rare night of lighthearted banter and genuine relaxation. A much needed night.
