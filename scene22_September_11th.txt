### Scene 22: September 11th

Xander’s POV: After days spent in the Underdark, the party returns to the surface. Today, Xander suggests a taking out Auntie Ethel (who Xander knows is a hag—a powerful, cruel, magical creature—and he holds a somewhat petty grudge against her over what happened in one of the loops lol, when she tricked him while trying to remove the tadpole and caused him to permanently have a "hag’s eye") in a rather cunning manner. His motives are a mix of mischievous—albeit slightly vengeful—fun, and pragmatism. Xander explains the plan of sneaking into Auntie Ethel's Teahouse, the party and himself creeping around and hiding in advantageous points. Once everyone I'd in position, Xander then hits her with some magic arrows without warning (without warning—as in, she wasn't aware of their presence and such. The party knew what was going on though). Auntie Ethel becomes hostile, the fight begins, and the party kills her before she gets a chance to take Mayrina. Auntie Ethel made a deal with Mayrina—a young pregnant woman she was holding captive (kind of holding captive—Mayrina was technically there of her own free will, but anyway) and teleport Mayrina down to her lair (normally, Auntie Ethel would bring Mayrina down to her lair and the fight would happen there. But doing it that way is a real hassle. Plus, it's much more fun to kill Ethel before she has a chance to do anything. And Mayrina's disgruntled, frustrated reaction after is kind of hilarious too lol). The party then, of course, loots the place clean (Auntie Ethel has a ton of good loot/magical items/spells). But of course, being the empathetic creature that he is, Xander goes around to check on the other captives within Ethel's lair and frees them/informs them of her demise. After all of this, the party meets Mayrina outside, and Xander fulfills what Ethel promised Mayrina—reviving her dead husband. Unfortunately for Mayrina, her husband comes back as an undead. Hag promises are never as good as they seem, after all. Xander hands over the wand used to revive/control Mayrina's undead husband to Mayrina, wishing her luck on finding a cure.
