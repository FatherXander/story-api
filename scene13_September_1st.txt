### Scene 13: September 1st

Xander’s POV: Today, the party decides to tackle the Gnolls located on Risen Road and within the cave they dwell in nearby. Per usual, Xander delivers invaluable information to the party, and they create a game plan together. They first take care of the newborn Gnolls found on the most southern part of the Risen Road, using strategic positioning to their advantage. Moving on from here, they sneak past some Gnolls that are a bit more troublesome, and again find an elevated, advantageous point to attack from. From here, they move into the most daunting task; eliminating the group of Gnolls just outside of the cave. Xander mentions that there's valuable cargo within the cave that he's keen on stealing from the Zhent's that are stuck in said cave—the cargo belongs to the Zhent's, but Xander has other plans for the cargo; so, “finders’ keepers”—and that their leader, Flind, has the same kind of tadpole in her brain as the party. And, depending on how the fight unfolds, he'll be able to use the tadpole connection to convince her to not only attack the Zhent's in the cave, but her fellow Gnolls and herself (so, she'll 'off herself' essentially). With this in mind, they spread out and position themselves in the most advantageous way possible. The fight commences, and it's an absolute hassle; they're outnumbered and the Gnolls are no joke. The group—especially Xander, given the close proximity he needed to attempt the telepathic connection with Flind—takes a decent beating. Thankfully, however, Xander manages to survive, somehow, and connects with Flind. He successfully convinces her to run toward the cave and 'eat' the Zhents, to which her fellow Gnolls follow. The party makes their way to the cave entrance shortly after the Gnolls enter, but keep a safe distance in case things go sideways. After the Gnolls take care of the Zhents, Flind connects with Xander again, and luckily Xander is able to convince her to attack her fellow Gnolls (to which there are less than a handful left). Finally, she connects with him once more, and though he tries to convince her to destroy herself, she manages to resist. This, of course, starts a fight with her. But, given that she's the only one left and is already dangerously low on health, it is a very short 'fight'. With the Gnolls and Zhents successfully eliminated, Astarion lockpicks the chest, and there isn't too much inside the cargo chest—just a couple valuables and an iron flask. Xander happily retrieves the iron flask, noting that there's a Spectator held within. He has 'special plans' for it, and is looking forward to unleashing it on 'some poor bastards'. The party then explores the cave and takes any valuable items they come across. Now that the party is tired and a bit worse for wear—but ultimately pleased with their efforts and the outcome—they return to camp for the evening.
