### Scene 32: September 20th

Xander’s POV: After another day spent kicking ass in the Shadowcursed Lands, Xander finds Astarion alone in camp. Astarion is shirtless, distracted, back turned to him. The large pattern of scars that Cazador carved into Astarion’s back immediately grabs his attention—and it is those scars that hold Astarion’s attention as well. He watches as Astarion attempts to decipher them, those deft fingers tracing along the deep, jagged edges. Astarion mumble something about the scars while blindly trying to read them, and curses bitterly. It takes him a moment to speak up and announce his presence to the rogue. His thoughts snag, lost in a dizzying sense of recollection. Gathering his thoughts, he greets Astarion. Astarion initially acts a bit defensively, clearly unaware that he was there. In the usual calm, gentle bluntness, he remarks on how the scars on Astarion’s back can't be read by touch alone—so the rogue’s efforts, while understandable, are relatively pointless. He then explains that he already knows what Astarion’s scars say and why Cazador carved them into Astarion’s back. (In all the prior loops, Astarion did this exact thing. In those loops, Xander would recreate Astarion’s scars in the dirt so that Astarion could see them—something Astarion has never been able to see before—and they determined that it Astarion’s scars were written in some infernal language. Without anyone to read them, Astarion would end up making a deal with Raphael. But… because of his memories of the loops, he can tell Astarion right now what the scars mean—and far more reliably than Raphael did. The bastard left out one very big, important detail. Devils and the bullshit. Gods.) So, he offers to explain everything to Astarion—that way Astarion won't have to make a deal with Raphael this time. And, you know, Astarion deserves to be given this information, regardless. Once Astarion agrees, he retrieves his journal and gives Astarion a piece of paper. On that paper is a detailed drawing of Astarion’s scars (something he drew a couple weeks prior) along with bullet points of information that relate to Astarion’s scars. As Astarion looks over the drawing and information, he delves into each bullet point. He explains that Astarion’s scars, while dubbed as a ‘poem’ by Cazador, don't technically say anything relevant to them—it's what those scars represent that's important. That representation being proof of a contract. The contract itself is between Cazador and the arch devil Mephistopheles. The infernal ‘proof of contract’ that Cazador carved into Astarion’s back centuries ago is needed for Cazador to perform a ritual and fulfill said contract. Astarion’s soul, the souls of Astarion’s six siblings, and the souls of an additional seven thousand people, are all bound to Mephistopheles—if Cazador completes the ritual. Now, the ritual is the Right of Profane Ascension. By performing the ritual and killing all those bound to Mephistopheles—Astarion, Astarion’s siblings, and the addition seven thousand people—Cazador’s end of the contract will be fulfilled, and Mephistopheles will grant Cazador with unfathomable power. Cazador will become the Vampire Ascendant, a being that, while still a vampire, will gain incredible strength, powers, and have the privileges of a mortal man restored. So, Cazador will be even more powerful, have even more abilities, and will also be walking around like a regular mortal. Walking in the sun, entering homes uninvited, feeling the hunger and desires of man. This, of course, comes with a catch. The price of performing the Right of Profane Ascension—aside from the thousands of souls signed off to Mephistopheles indefinitely—is humanity. If Cazador were to complete the ritual and become the Vampire Ascendant, any remaining humanity left in him (which, obviously, is next to none) would be permanently lost. As he finishes the explanation, he preemptively ‘answers’ what he believes Astarion will ask (based on what Astarion said and did in the prior loops after they discovered this information). He says that while Astarion can take Cazador’s place in the ritual, Astarion never performed the Right of Profane Ascension in the prior loops. Astarion wanted to, but in those loops, once they made it to Szarr Palace and did some poking around, they discovered the ‘additional seven thousand souls.’ Those people were all of the victims that Astarion, and Astarion’s six siblings, had seduced and lured to Cazador (under the assumption that Cazador was feeding on them). For centuries, Cazador has been keeping these people—whom he turned every single one into a vampire spawn—in a secret prison dungeon under the Palace. Because they knew the ritual would effectively erase the humanity of whoever performs it, and they knew that these seven thousand victims would also be paying the price, it cracked Astarion’s resolve to complete it—albeit slightly. When they beat the shit of a Cazador, the bastard being on death's door, Astarion has always asked him to aid with completing the ritual. But he could see that Astarion’s desire to do the ritual wasn't out of genuine want or need—it was Astarion’s fear. Fear of being weak, of being not good enough, of falling into the hands of another person like Cazador. Instead of outright refusing or accepting to help, he reminded Astarion of the permanent loss of humanity. That the thousands of people needed to be sacrificed and damned to the hells are in the same situation Astarion was in before being kidnapped by the mind flayers. And that Astarion would permanently loss a sense of self. In the end, Astarion would concede, stab the ever-loving shit out of Cazador—killing the fucker once and for all—and free everyone. Astarion broke the cycle of pain and terror that started centuries ago, rather than starting a new one. And, despite giving up all that unimaginable power, Astarion was happy and expressed feeling ‘truly, honestly free.’ He adds that it was his favorite part of the journey in every single loop—helping Astarion gain freedom, watching Astarion kill Cazador, and seeing how relieved Astarion was afterwards. And lastly, he affirms that he'll help Astarion kill Cazador again—and since they have the power of foreknowledge on their side, Xander says it'll be “twice as awesome” this time.
