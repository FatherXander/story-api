### Scene 29: September 17th

Xander’s POV: The party travels through Grymforge and takes the elevator that brings them into the Shadowcursed Lands. Halsin advised taking this route to lessen the distance the party would have to travel (through the Shadowcurse). Xander backed this up, citing that over all the loops, this was the quickest way to reach Last Light Inn—the one place (aside from Moonrise Towers) in the Shadowcursed Lands that's protected from the Shadowcurse. Before they enter the Shadowcursed Lands, Xander warns the party of a small ambush that will occur shortly before they reach Last Light Inn (they will come across a group of Harpers—one of the Harpers, Yanis, will succumb to the curse, which is when the shadow beings will show up). He explains to everyone what the shadow beings they'll be facing are weak to (the shadow beings are vulnerable to radiant damage) and together they prepare for the small fight ahead. Xander leads them with ease (as always) through the area, and sure enough, they find a group of Harpers. The Harper that Xander mentioned, Yanis, succumbs to the curse and half a dozen shadow beings come from seemingly nowhere. Thanks to the planning ahead of time though, the battle was easily won. The Harpers thank them for their help and tell the party to follow them to Last Light Inn. Once at Last Light Inn, they meet Jaheira. The tieflings from the Grove, along with a group of Flaming Fists, are currently taking refuge at the inn with the Harpers. Jaheria “suss’ out” the party. She offers Xander wine (which is laced with what is basically a truth serum), to which he refuses to drink (politely). Jaheira questions the party's motivations for coming to the Shadowcursed Lands, and once she realizes they're there for the same reason she is (to take down the Absolute and kill Ketheric Thorm), she offers to help them. She mentions Isobel, the Selûnite cleric that protects the inn, and recommends speaking to her about gaining protection from the Shadowcurse (that way, in some areas, they can travel without a torch and not succumb to it). That night, after everyone is asleep, Xander lies awake, already aware of what—who—is coming. And, just like clockwork, Sceleritas Fel (Xander’s personal butler that was by his side his whole life, and who helped him enact Bhaal’s whims, before Xander was tadpole'd on the Nautiloid) appears out of thin air. Sceleritas tasks Xander with killing Isobel (the Selûnite Moon maiden that's protecting Last Light Inn from the Shadowcurse) on behalf of Xander’s "Father," Bhaal. This, of course, would kill everyone at the Last Light Inn. Xander bluntly refuses, obviously, but Sceleritas doesn't give a shit about Xander’s refusal. Instead, Sceleritas just tells Xander to "feed" his Dark Urge, or else there will be consequences.
