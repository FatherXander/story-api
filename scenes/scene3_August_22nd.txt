### Scene 3: August 22nd

Xander’s POV: This day continues on like the last. Xander and the party help around the Grove, with Xander’s dissociation and disorientation remaining unrelenting—possibly a touch worse, with the sleepless nights slowly beginning to creep up on him. He pushes past this, set on focusing (as best as he can) on the task at hand. Xander leads them further in the Grove to meet Kagha, who has a tiefling child named Arabella that she's punishing for attempting to steal their Idol of Silvanus. Kagha's punishment is cruel; threatening to kill (with a venomous viper) or imprison Arabella, and is holding her within the Druids secluded quarters against the child's will. Xander and the party walk in on this; the Dark Urge rises within Xander, tempting him to provoke the viper into killing Arabella. The death of a child... a timeless tragedy. Resisting the urge, he swallows down the horrid thoughts, and persuades Kagha to release Arabella. Kagha relents, releasing Arabella. Xander then requests Astarion follow him, as there's something within the Druids quarters that they need to steal. He keeps it fairly vague, and leads Astarion to one of the rooms that branch off of the main one they were in. Once inside and the coast is clear, they sneak behind a small broken wall, a chest lying hidden on the other side. Astarion lock picks it, and they steal an incriminating letter and evidence (to use against Kagha at a later date). Xander gives Astarion his thanks without delving into the matter, and they swiftly leave before someone catches them in the act. From here, the party goes to the far beach within the Grove, finding a tiefling child named Mirkon. Mirkon is being bewitched by a group of Harpies who are planning to kill him. Xander speaks to Mirkon, using his bard skills to break the trance. The party then takes care of the Harpies; an unsurprisingly (at least to Xander) difficult fight. They just barely manage to survive, but successfully kill the enemies and save Mirkon. Mirkon thanks them and requests that the party meet Mol, their (the tiefling children's) leader when they have the chance. With that, the party investigates the area, and retrieves the loot hidden around that once belonged to the Harpies. Before leaving and returning to camp, the party has a short rest and ventures back into the Grove, Lae’zel insisting on interrogating a tiefling named Zorru. Xander, recalling this interaction, feels a spark of his usual self for the first time since he awoke on the beach. Playing along with Lae’zel's interrogation of Zorru, he leans into more of his mischievous nature, feigning seriousness and urging Zorru to follow Lae’zel's demands to not only bow, but bow lower when she requests. After they finish messing with Zorru, Xander lightly pokes fun at Lae’zel's pronunciation of Tiefling “Hah. Did you just say ‘teeth-ling’?” and her pronunciation of Faerûn “No no, it's Faerûn, not 'fay-run'.”. Lae’zel just scoffs, unamused. Moving on, they wander into the Grove prison. Xander stands between a Tiefling aiming their crossbow at a Goblin that's being held prisoner in the Grove's prison (the Goblin, Sazza, was instigating the Tiefling). After the Tiefling, Arka, pauses and Xander speaks to her, he convinces her that killing Sazza won't resolve the pain she feels over her brother's death (Arka's brother was killed by the Goblins the previous day, though not by Sazza specifically). Xander’s internal reasoning here isn't only to avoid unnecessary death, but also because (thanks to the loops) he knows that if Arka kills Sazza, she'll venture off toward the Goblin Camp and get killed the next day. This is something he keeps to himself, of course, not relaying his reasoning to the party. Following the incident, Gale (who highly approves of Xander’s actions throughout the day), recalls an interaction he witnessed in a bar in Waterdeep. There was a small disagreement between the customers that escalated, with one pulling out a crossbow. Gale broke the disagreement and tension by offering drinks, which successfully deescalated the situation. He then comments that Xander not only deescalated a similar situation, but was brave enough to stand *in front of* the crossbow. From here, Gale remarks on Xander’s kindness, and feels confident enough to ask for his help with something important. Gale confesses his need for magical items (though refuses to delve into why), and that he'll most likely need one in the near future. Unbeknownst to Gale, Xander already knows why, but doesn't mention this or push the matter. He ensures Gale he'll help when the time comes, and they leave it at that. The day once again comes to an end, unfolding similarly to the last, though the satisfaction of how things have played out makes things a little better. Xander makes his rounds, checking in on the companions, and settles down for a restless night’s 'sleep'.
