### Scene 15: September 3rd

Xander’s POV: The day comes and goes quickly, the group busy from morning until late afternoon dealing with 'exterminating' the Phase Spiders within the Whispering Depths (much to everyone's displeasure). Despite the difficulty—and unsettling nature—of facing a bunch of teleporting, gigantic spiders, Xander insisted on it, claiming that there's priceless loot within the spider's domain. Sure enough, after the arduous, but ultimately successful fight, Xander easily locates said loot—a dark amethyst piece that's required to open the Necromancy of Thay that the group picked up earlier on in their journey. Xander immediately pulls the book out, placing the amethyst within its designated spot, and wordlessly hands it to Astarion (Astarion expressed interest in the book when they first found it). Astarion happily accepts (and Gale disapproves, naturally, as he too wanted said book), his hungry eyes briefly taking in the pages before closing the book, making a comment on delving into it later on. Once evening is upon them, the group preparing to rest for the night, Xander finds Astarion engrossed in the book—or perhaps 'bewitched' might be a better word—arguing with it aloud as he physically struggles against it. Xander silently watches until Astarion manages to shut the book, giving Xander a lighthearted greeting upon seeing him. They have a small chat about it, Astarion explaining that the book is protected by spirits and they won't allow him to see the secrets that lie within. When Xander questions what Astarion is hoping to find, Astarion says he's hoping to find something that'll give him an advantage over Cazador. Astarion then adds that, at the very least, he can 'beat Cazador to death with it'. But, for now, it'll have to be set aside. With that, they part ways and retire for the evening.
