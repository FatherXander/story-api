### Scene 33: September 21st

Xander’s POV: Over the course of two days, Xander continues to lead the party through the Shadowcursed Lands. As they explore the area, there are specific places he wants to ‘visit’ with the intention of killing a few people in particular. Well, the way he wants to kill them is what has him extra interested. And the murder of it all is just one reason. Some of these places and people have items that they require in order to aid the refugees, Harpers, and Flaming Fists at Last Light Inn. And there's a bunch of sweet loot too, like always. But—but—he in especially excited about killing these people because of how he's going to kill them. That is death by a silver tongue, of course. And so, today, he plans on killing all three Thorm siblings (Thisobald, Malus, and Gerringothe Thorm). Tomorrow, it’ll be Yurgir—the orthon Raphael would’ve required Astarion to kill in exchange for information (but because Xander told Astarion everything back on September 20th, the deal was never made). Similarly to how he killed Kar'niss, Xander plans to talk them to death. Well, technically speaking, he uses his persuasive ways to convince Gerringothe, Malus, and Yurgir to kill themselves—but he quite literally talks Thisobald to death (whom he genuinely finds interesting and likes talking to, so he ever so slightly sulks about the fact that he has to kill Thisobald). Thisobald, found in a what would've once been a bar, is a massive creature. Tall and large, large to the point that Thisobald’s belly is physically struggling to hold itself together. Upon entering the bar, the shadowcursed man seems mentally stunted, almost childlike. Thisobald insists that Xander sit down and drink some specialty ‘elixir’ (a vile concoction that Xander has no intention of drinking). He ‘concedes,’ pretending to drink with Thisobald. Thisobald then requests that Xander ‘tell a story’—to recount an exciting experience from the party’s journey thus far. Xander happily complies, retelling several different quests they've completed along the way. Thisobald, enthralled and drinking mug after mug of this ‘elixir,’ eventually bursts open. Literally. Thisobald’s large body, holding on by thread, simply gives way like a cracked dam. Xander sighs, picks up the mug of elixir, and pours it out for Thisobald. “Rest well, funny man,” he says, mostly to himself, then abruptly turns his attention to the party. “Let’s take all the alcohol home with us, yeah?” Not waiting for an answer, he grins playfully and begins nonchalantly stashing the alcohol around the bar. “There’s damn-near every kind here. And there’s so much we probably wouldn’t run out, even after our journey comes to a close.” Working together, they search every corner of the run-down establishment. With packs filled to the absolute brim with drinks, they head to the basement before moving on. In the basement, they find Thisobald’s old laboratory. Prior to becoming consumed by the shadowcurse, Thisobald use to be a brilliant man, if a tad dangerous. They manage to collect an array of potions, alchemical ingredients, a recipe for Thisobald’s lethal concoction, and some more (mundane) supplies. They make a brief stop at camp to drop off the comical amount of alcohol and wine, then head back out to finish off the two other siblings. Malus, a twisted surgeon at the old hospital, and Gerringothe, a toll collector at the tollhouse, are not as ‘pleasant’ in his opinion, but still interesting in their own way (and interesting to kill, even if a little less fun). Arriving at the hospital, Xander and the party walk in on Malus performing an ‘educational’ surgery for the shadowcursed ‘sisters’ (nurses, basically). Xander approaches Malus, feigning casual curiosity. Malus gestures at Xander, the surgeon’s modified ‘hands’ glinting in the sterile light. It’s as if someone took a deft, mechanical claw and gave it the shape and sharpness of a sickle. Malus’ hands and legs are replaced with agile metal appendages. Hands that once healed now built solely to kill, legs that once walked now built to swiftly lunge. Malus remarks that Xander must be a ‘new student’ seeking to learn the Dark Ladie’s ways. Xander humors Malus, agreeing, listening to the reasoning for torture and how it's ‘healing.’ Once Malus tries to suggest that Xander should try being a patient for the sisters to practice on, Xander easily turns it around. He twists Malus’ reasoning and suggests that Malus should be the one the ‘sisters’ perform surgery. After all, Malus is the teacher. Who better to show the sister what to do? Malus, as if enlightened, enthusiastically encourages the sisters to do so. The surgeon cruelly shoves the (now) dead ‘patient’ off the surgery table and hopes on. Obviously, the dumbass dies—quite brutally, honestly. The sisters, after slaughtering Malus, roam about the room as if nothing had happened. Xander loots Malus’ body, and together the party spends time looting the entire hospital. Again, they gather a lot of supplies. Not quite as much as Thisobald’s bar in comparison, at least weight wise. With the day nearing a close, Xander says that they’ll head to the tollhouse, kill Gerringothe, and then head to camp. There’s a crap-ton of gold at the tollhouse, among other items that they can obtain, but they’ll leave the goods there overnight and grab it tomorrow (it’s not like anyone is going to come by and steal shit in the Shadowcursed Lands, after all). Sneaking in through the rooftop, the party enters the tollhouse. Immediately, Gerringothe spots them. Gerringothe, a creature that’s basically the manifestation of greed, bluntly demands they hand over some gold. Xander wordlessly concedes and tosses a gold coin to the collector. Gerringothe catches it, absorbing the gold piece like one would inhale tobacco from a pipe. Then, Gerringothe demands for more gold. Of course. Xander questions why he needs to pay for more, and Gerringothe says it's to pass the river. So, he ‘pays,’ tossing over another gold coin. Just like before, Gerringothe absorbs it. But still, demands for even more gold. Xander then asks why Gerringothe is still here, collecting gold in a closed down tollhouse, despite being ‘relieved’ of toll collecting duties. “There isn't a need for a toll collector, there's no toll to pay. Why stay? You’re free now.” Gerringothe, too mentally worn from years spent as a shadowcursed being, can't comprehend this. The cognitive dissonance is immediate, and the only thing Gerringothe replies with is the word ‘gold,’ again and again and again. It’s manic at first, then questioning, then ultimately, reluctantly, accepting. After the moment of madness, Gerringothe says they'll ‘give it back.’ Not unlike Thisobald, Gerringothe abruptly explodes into a pile of gold. Small piles of gold coins scatter all over the decaying floorboards. Xander gestures around lazily and sighs, satisfied. “Ahh, what a productive yet easy day. Shall we head to camp and have some wine? Just for the fun of it?” With that last little remark, they depart for camp. And, you know. Enjoy some spoils, just because.
