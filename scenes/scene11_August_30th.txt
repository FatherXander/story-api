### Scene 11: August 30th

Xander’s POV: The party—Xander, Astarion, Karlach, and Lae’zel—settles on dealing with a much less tiring task (compared to yesterday) for today. Xander mentions there being an underground hidden forge and cellar within the Blighted Village. There's a forge that has useful items and weapons—the forge itself can't be used until they retrieve necessary items from the Underdark, but no harm in grabbing the loot. The cellar, on the other hand, has scrolls, useful crafting items, and potions lying about, along with a powerful book locked away within. He cites that although they'll need an additional item to open the book itself, it wouldn't hurt to retrieve it now. Xander leads them to the hidden forge first, and the party searches around, retrieving various weapons and tools. Astarion disarms and lockpicks a chest that holds weapon blueprints for the forge, and, sure enough, it demands 'Sussar bark'—which is found on Sussar Trees within the Underdark. After unlocking another chest, they find Infernal Iron, something that Karlach will need to fix up her engine. Xander remarks on how they'll have to stop by the Grove and see Dammon (a tiefling who's an infernal mechanic), and have him provide an upgrade for Karlach (much to Karlach excitement and approval). From here, the party exits the forge and moves onto the cellar. They again search around, picking up a plethora of potions and alchemical items. Xander leads them to a hidden area within the cellar, to which they find a magical, ornate mirror. Xander speaks to it, answering its cryptic riddles and questions. The last question, 'If you could see anything in me, what would it be?', Xander answers with, “I'd see you free.” The mirror initially bristles at this, commenting that this is its purpose. But it calms and becomes appreciative, noting that no one has ever bothered to consider its freedom or wants. It happily welcomes the party, and reveals the hidden room behind itself. The hidden room behind the mirror contains scrolls, more alchemical items, and the book that's locked away behind a door and traps. Astarion disarms the traps and unlocks the door, and Xander retrieves the book itself and stashes it away in his pack. There are a few items that they gather as they make their way out, but otherwise, they've looted the place clean. And thus, they make one last stop, dropping by the Grove to see Dammon. Dammon makes short work of the Infernal iron, hands it to Karlach, and Karlach installs said piece into her Infernal engine. Karlach, elated and pleased with the outcome, remarks on feeling better—that it doesn't feel as though she's about to overheat. She's still incredibly hot—but not overwhelmingly so. Dammon in turn is happy with the outcome, and promises to mull over her situation in hopes of resolving her problem. He recommends holding onto any Infernal iron they find, and that when they (Dammon and the tiefling refugees) make it to Baldur's Gate, the party should meet up with him so they can sort things out for Karlach. The party happily agrees, and makes their way to camp for the evening. Now, with the day nearly over, Xander takes his time to check in on everyone (including Scratch who he pets and plays fetch with) and proceeds to busy himself with his journal. After an indiscernible amount of time, the entire group retires for the night and heads to bed.
