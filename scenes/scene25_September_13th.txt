### Scene 25: September 13th

Xander’s POV: The party returns to the Goblin Camp, planning to eliminate the remaining goblins and their three leaders. They enter the Temple/camp, all the goblins blissfully unaware of the massacre that the party enacted yesterday. Thanks to this ignorance, the party roams around freely amongst the goblins inside. Before beginning the assault, Xander mentions wanting to do something “a little unorthodox, but ultimately useful,” first. They enter a slightly secluded room; one that's dark and empty save for one man. This man is Abdirak, a priest of the Goddess Loviatar (the Goddess of Pain). Xander, being aware of who Abdirak is (Xander recalls meeting Abdirak in previous loops), asks Abdirak about his goddess. Abdirak, in turn, is surprised by Xander’s interest in Loviatar—Abdirak doesn't encounter many who know of his goddess, especially amidst the goblins within the camp. Abdirak offers to share his Goddess’ teachings with Xander. The ‘teachings,’ of course, involve Abdirak inflicted pain upon Xander. In other words, Abdirak is offering to beat Xander with a weapon—a scourge, specifically. If Xander impresses the Goddess Loviatar during Abdirak’s teachings, Xander has the possibility of gaining Loviatar’s Blessing. As Abdirak explains this, there's a certain soft edge to man's voice—one that sounds rather excited. Once Abdirak offers Xander the chance to experience the teachings, some of the party chimes in. Gale, having one of the strongest connections with Xander, hums apprehensively and says, “Not my cup of tea, personally. But to each their own.” Shadowheart quirks a brow at Gale, a smile gracing her features as she adds, “I'm rather curious, personally. But do try to keep him alive, Priest. I may have use for him yet.” Astarion, clearly delighted and turn-on by the prospect of witnessing this, murmurs in a sultry tone, “Mmm… I must see this. Don't you dare say no.” Xander quickly shoots them a knowing grin, then turns his attention back to Abdirak. Xander accepts Abdirak’s offer. Abdirak, seemingly very pleased, requests that Xander walk forward and face the wall. Xander complies. In front of the wall, he raises his hands just above his head and braces himself against the wall. Then, the ‘teaching’ begins. Abdirak takes his time. Each sting of his scourge is delivered one merciless blow at a time, earning instinctive sounds from Xander. Between each hit Xander’s body receives, Abdirak—speaking in a hot and heavy tone, a blend of reverence and excitement—provides words of encouragement and praise. Xander, in response, breathlessly provokes the Priest. And the party, standing just a few feet back, watch the whole scene unfold. They throw out comments here and there, or poke fun at each other's reactions. At one point, Astarion’s expression gains an almost lascivious edge, his gaze locked onto Xander—and he muses aloud, “My, my. Who knew our friend had so much blood in them?” Shadowheart manages to peel her eyes away from the ‘display’ and gives Astarion a look. “Must you lick your lips while you say that?” She asks the rogue rhetorically, amused. Astarion and Shadowheart are, by far, invested in Abdirak beating Xander. The other companions—Gale, Karlach, Wyll, Lae'zel—and definitely not so interested. Perhaps even a tad concerned. Nevertheless, Xander successfully endures the teaching. Abdirak informs Xander of the success, and it's apparent that the Priest’s is both impressed and enraptured. Abdirak performs a very short ritual on Xander, and voilà—Xander receives Loviatar's Blessing (which is a very nice 'buff' to have in battle, hence why he wanted to go through with the teachings). Before parting ways, Abdirak leans in close to Xander and murmurs, “Thank you, dear one. That was simply… divine.” With that taken care of, the party then moves on. In the next room—a small makeshift torture room—Xander uses his deceitful ways and convinces the prison guards to leave said room (claiming he's there to ‘take over’). Once gone, they free the lone prisoner there, a man named Liam. Because of Xander’s foreknowledge, he already knows the information that Liam could've provided them (Xander shared this information with the party when they planned this mission yesterday). So, the party moves on. Entering the main room, they climb up a ladder to reach some rafters up above. With a clear view of the room and goblins below—which one of the goblin leaders, Priestess Gut, is standing in the middle of—the party commences their sneak attack on the enemies below. The battle, like most, is won without much trouble. Once the goblins inside this main room are defeated, the party climbs down the ladder. In a room adjacent to Abdirak’s, the party finds a single goblin guarding a crude cage. Inside said cage is Volo. Astarion sneaks up on the guard and kills them in a single strike. Xander retrieves the key from the corpse and releases Volo. Volo thanks them and says that he wishes to speak with them—but at a safer location. Xander, knowing exactly who Volo is, suggests that Volo reside at their camp. Volo agrees, drinks an invisibility potion, and leaves. The party moves on, stealthily attacking two more rooms located further inside the temple—they kill roughly another half a dozen enemies. In one of the rooms, which is another prison, they find the Arch Druid Halsin. Seven goblins, two of which are children, are inside. Halsin is currently in wild shape as a bear, locked in a cell. The two goblin children, along with a goblin guard, are antagonizing the ‘bear’ druid. Without wasting time on pleasantries, the party attacks. During the fight, Halsin breaks out of his cell and begins attacking alongside the party. After the fight ends, the goblins in the prison room defeated, Halsin thanks them. As Halsin speaks to Xander, the druid realizes they're all infected with mindflayer tadpoles. Halsin tells them he'll help the party find a cure once all three goblin leaders are defeated (thus ensuring his Grove is safe). The party agrees. Xander tells Halsin that they'll meet him at the Grove afterwards. Halsin uses wild shape to take form of a mouse and leaves the camp to return to the Grove. Leaving the prison, the party enters an adjacent room. Inside, they defeat a handful of enemies—one being Minthara the Nightwarden, the second goblin leader. And finally, the party makes their way to the final room of the camp. There are approximately a dozen enemies within, one of which is Dror Ragzin, the third and final leader of the goblin camp. Using the rafters to their advantage, the party makes quick work of the enemies and Dror Ragzin. The party is exhausted, spells spent and low on potions, but they successfully defeated the entire Goblin Camp. Their plan worked flawlessly. Despite the fatigue, the resounding victory is exhilarating. With all three leaders dead and the threats eliminated, the party loots the rest of the camp, and then travels to the Grove. The party arrives at the Grove and informs Zevlor and Halsin of the goblin's defeat. Both men are grateful for the party's help in eliminating the goblins, as it provides the tieflings with safe passage to start traveling towards Baldur's Gate. In honor of the party's victory, and to simply enjoy the pleasures of alcohol and good company, Zevlor proposes a celebration that very evening. The party accepts. By the time the party returns to camp to celebrate, it's now early evening. At the start of the Tiefling Celebration, Xander speaks to Astarion first. He tells the rogue that he'll be busy "playing host" for a bit. Xander openly admits to his interest in spending time with Astarion tonight, and teasingly asks that Astarion “try not to run off” in the meantime. With a flirtatious grin and wink, he does just as he said he would—plays host. Well, not so much ‘plays’ as he quite literally is being a stand in host. He speaks to everyone. Xander exchanges words with each and every tiefling from the Grove—sharing drinks and jokes, providing encouragement for the journey to Baldur's Gate, indulging in drunk shenanigans, playing a quick tune with Alfira. He speaks to Halsin, trying to encourage the druid to join in on the festivities. He takes his time talking with his companions, one on one. Xander has a lengthy conversation with Gale, one that is intimate certainly, but not necessarily romantic. All the while, everyone—tieflings and companions alike—mingle together, drink to their hearts content, and enjoy themselves. Once Xander finishes checking in on everyone, he returns to Astarion and unabashedly flirts with the rogue. In spite of what one may anticipate on a night such as this, Xander doesn't proposition having sex with Astarion. Instead, while they talk and drink wine (Astarion isn't a fan of wine because it tastes like a vinegar to him, but he grabbed a bottle earlier and is drinking it anyway), Xander tells Astarion that he wants to stay with Astarion tonight. Not to have sex, but to simply enjoy Astarion’s company. Xander then adds that there's no pressure. He says that if Astarion is dead set on having sex with someone tonight, he would understand—but the offer is there, regardless.
