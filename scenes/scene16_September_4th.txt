### Scene 16: September 4th

Xander’s POV: Utilizing his persuasion, Xander gains the party access into the Zhentarim Hideout. Despite what he tells the Zhentarim leader—which is that the party is there to trade—are in, in fact, not there to trade. Oh, no. They're there for much more exciting reasons. After deceiving the leader, he and the party hide near the entrance. It overlooks the main portion of the Zhent Hideout. Down below, there are a handful of Zhentarim traders—and loot, of course. The Zhentarim are busy spreading flammable oil and explosives around the hideout (the Zhentarim intended to abandon their hideout and blow it up). So, naturally, he wants to ‘help’. Without an ounce of reservation, Xander pulls out a bottle of alchemy fire and throws it down below. This causes an immediate explosion—and because of how the Zhentarim have spread out the explosives and oil, it acta like a chain reaction. And because he ensured the party remained up above the hideout at the entrance, they're more than safe. A handful of the Zhentarim parish almost instantly, save for the leader (who was in an area too high for the explosion to reach). After the fire dies down, the party retrieves the loot in the initial area and off of the dead Zhentarim. Then, they sneak to the back of the hideout. The Zhentarim leader, along with another handful of her people, are guarding the rear of the hideout. Some of the party breaks off, but not too far. Just enough to subtly surround the remaining Zhentarim. Once in position, Xander grabs the Iron Flask (that they retrieved from the Gnolls cave on September 1st) and throws it at the remaining Zhentarim. The flask breaks open and a Spectator monster (Spectators are monsters categorized as aberrations. They have four eyestalks that can each cast debilitating rays. The Spectator's multiple eyestalks allow it to cast multiple rays, and a giant razor-sharp mouth with multiple rows of teeth. They have the ability to cast Charm Person, Confusion, Fear, Paralysis, Petrification, Unpetrification, and Wounding Ray.) The Spectator immediately starts attacking the Zhentarim. Once the Zhent's numbers are depleted and the Spectator is dead, the party jumps in and ambushes the remaining survivors. After they succeed, they loot the dead Zhentarim and the rooms that they were guarding. Xander had multiple reasons for all of this. One, for fun. Two, to steal all the Zhent's valuables. And lastly, to gain access to the Zhentarim elevator. The elevator, hidden by an illusion wall, leads to the Underdark. Because of Xander’s foreknowledge (his memories of previous time loops), he knows that this elevator is the safest entrance point to the Underdark. And that it happens to have even more of the Zhent's loot at the bottom. Later that same day, as the party is resting at camp, Xander speaks to Astarion. Xander brings up his actions during the first feeding (back on August 28th)—how he embraced Astarion during the first feeding. He apologizes for holding Astarion without permission. His tone is mindful yet blunt—frank tenderness, one might call it. His apology is sincere, nonetheless. He asks if Astarion would like to feed on him tonight, which Astarion accepts. Then, before the second feeding begins, he asks permission to hold Astarion. Astarion, in his usual charming way, provides permission. The feeding itself is a success. Astarion bites into Xander’s neck—and unlike the first time, Astarion controls his hunger as he drinks the bard’s blood. Astarion has no problem stopping himself once satiated. Xander is left unharmed, a little dizzy maybe, but even that is negligible. From this day forward, Xander offers himself—his neck, his blood—to Astarion every night.
