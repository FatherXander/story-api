### Scene 5: August 24th

Xander’s POV: As the entire party wanders around for the day, they explore and deal with trouble along the way. They save a dying gnome surrounded by goblins within a secret entrance to the Grove, then retrieve loot within said area. Venturing outside the Blighted Village, they come across Scratch, a dog whose owner died due to a fatal encounter with Gnolls. With the use of the Speak with Animals potion, Xander suggests Scratch live with them (Scratch believes his master will wake) and offers Scratch to pick up his scent so the pup can find their camp 'if' his master doesn't wake. Moving further north toward the Risen Road, Xander suggests taking a different path around, pointing out the Gnolls that are barely visible up ahead—so they climb down a rock face and travel down a path next to the river. Xander 'happens' to find a magic ring along the way, and at the end of the path they find a Tiefling who's lit up in flames. Unbeknownst to the rest of the party, Xander knows it's Karlach. He approaches her with ease, grabbing her attention. There's a momentary connection between them with the tadpoles, to which Xander witnesses the same vision from her as always (her fighting in the Blood War in Avernus, and escaping on the Nautiloid; only to be captured within said vessel, a tadpole subsequently making its home in her brain), though is unsure what she could've possibly seen from Xander on her end. It mustn't have been significant though, as she continues on as usual, friendly and fierce like always. When offered to join them, she agrees, but on the condition of aiding her take down some fake Paladins of Tyr. Xander agrees and she joins the group. After they deal with the fake Paladins and loot the Toll House that the Paladins had taken over, the party decides it's best to call it a day. Just as they begin to make their way back, Xander abruptly remarks on needing to run back to the Grove, and that he'll meet them back at camp once he's done. He mentions needing to buy supplies from Arron (a seller/trader), and sets off for the Grove. Xander, however, is actually going to the Grove for a different reason. He still stops by Arron because they do need more supplies, but his main purpose for going there was to hopefully prevent what would be a tragedy. In the previous loops, a tiefling bard named Alfira would show up around this time, and the Dark Urge would take over Xander, causing him to kill her in his sleep. It's outside of his control entirely, and knowing this is going to occur, he's dead-set on avoiding it. Xander speaks with Alfira, aids her in completing her song that she was working on, and leaves the immediate area she's in. Using a scroll of invisibility, he sneaks back over to her, and knocks her unconscious. He's unsure if it'll work, but still a touch hopeful. If he could put this burden of awareness to use and save her life, it'll make all the difference. Returning to camp, Xander waits patiently, silently waiting for Wyll to arrive. Sure enough, in the early evening, Wyll shows up. He confronts Karlach, determined to take her down. However, after Wyll and Karlach have a brief tadpole connection of their own, Wyll's resolve wavers. Xander persuades Wyll, reiterating that Karlach isn't the evil he thinks she is—she's the same as the innocents he swears to protect day in and out. Wyll concedes, offering a truce to Karlach, to which Karlach replies with a counteroffer of being allies. Wyll then joins the party, of course. But—much to the party's surprise (and Xander’s quiet horror/dismay), a random adventurer shows up shortly afterwards; a dragonborn by the name of Quill Grootslang. Xander feels thrown off entirely, taken aback by her plea to join them, much like Alfira had in the previous loops. He tries to dissuade Quill, telling her that it's dangerous to join them, and it'd be best if she didn't put herself at risk. Quill, on the other hand, is determined to stay. Xander reluctantly relents, making the internal decision to avoid sleep for the night, in hopes Quill doesn't face the tragedy Alfira had in the loops. The party settles for the evening, heading off to sleep. Xander, on the other hand, remains awake.

Hours pass.

Xander’s POV: Xander sits against the rock formation next to the bedrolls, tired eyes fixated on the campfire, his companions sleeping soundly nearby. As the night drags on into the wee hours of the morning, time moving painfully slowly, exhaustion has cropped up just as painfully. The fear of sleep itself and of the Urge rearing its ugly head, despite his efforts to thwart it, fuel him into a forced state of consciousness. For a while, this technically 'helps'. Before the sway of sleep can even be processed, his mind would flood with immeasurable memories of Alfira; gruesomely contorted by his wicked hand. Wave after wave of fear and panic keep him sickeningly alert. Convincing himself that it'll be over soon, that dawn will break if he just holds on a little longer, again and again throughout the late evening. It won't be much longer. Just a few more hours. Do this or your efforts will be in vain. You want to save them, don't you? You can save them if you don't sleep. Just for one more night. Don't sleep. As the night drags on into pre-dawn morning, almost reluctantly, something foreign grabs hold of Xander. His forced alertness suddenly wanes, the previous nights he spent barely sleeping now making themselves starkly known. It happens so quickly he has no time to act, to fight it. Panic rises within him, but it makes no difference—in a single blink, he's out, slumped against the rock. It's as if only a moment has passed. As Xander lurches awake, he can only process his body and head screaming in exhaustion and pain. Eyes screwed shut and head pounding, he staggers wildly. His body, limbs, head, seemingly down to every muscle and fiber; agonizingly tired and sore beyond measure. It takes an embarrassing amount of strength to raise hands, rubbing his eyes and face. Then he feels it. Still swaying and staggering, Xander pulls his hands back from his face; a sticky, slick, wet substance making his face and hands feel cool in the morning breeze. It's thick, giving the air a strong metallic smell. His stomach twists, wanting to deny what he already knows to be true. Perhaps, if he doesn't open his eyes, he won't have to accept it. His foot catches on something, almost tripping him in his swaying stupor. Out of reflex, his eyes open—and his fears are realized. Quill’s body lies at his feet, gory and nearly beyond recognition. Xander is frozen, staring in horror at the sight in front of him. He manages to rip his gaze away from her decimated body, to his hands caked in her blood and gore, beginning to congeal. Glancing down at himself he takes in the blood that's sprayed and spattered, covering his body. The stark reality of what's happened hits him—despite his efforts, despite the misery he's put himself through, despite having the knowledge and power of what's to come; this is unequivocally unavoidable. Something breaks internally. Sheer terror, panic, and dread overwhelm him in an instant. Xander drops to his knees next to Quill, refusing the truth of what's happened. Of what he's done. His face in his hands, he slouches over, quietly whispering nonsense to himself. He keeps shutting his eyes and opening them, only to find things as they were. His whispering quickly raises in volume, yelling in disbelief. He reaches out to Quill, trying to shake her awake. He's frantic, erratic, irrational. His face twisted, horrified, feeling compelled to cry but can't. Without warning, he feels a hand on his shoulder. Xander stops, slowly glancing over. His companions—all of them—stand behind him, bewildered. Disturbed. Terrified. 

Shadowheart's POV: “Xander?” Shadowheart calls out warily, carefully lowering her hand and watching Xander with wide eyes.

Xander’s POV: Xander can see as they take in the scene before them. They all seem so hesitant, as if at any moment he's going to lunge at them. Like some… monster. His heart begins pounding harshly, his chest aching. He looks away from his companions, whom he's grown to care for more than anything, too afraid to hear what they say or think of him. They have every reason to be terrified and scared of him. He's unintentionally given them the impression he's unhinged, psychotic. A dangerous threat to them. His body trembles and a tingling numbness spread in his face and extremities. The impending doom sinks in like a one-ton stone. His worst, most intense fears have been actualized. This is it. Any miniscule amount of trust he's garnered is gone. “...They'll never trust me again.” He mutters, nearly inaudible, “How could I fuck it up this badly? I tried to do everything right, everything perfect.” Stuck in a dissociative state, he's unable to register his name and the confused clamoring behind him. Xander mumbles on to himself incoherently, “But it couldn't have gone more wrong. I don't understand! Knowing what's to come, shouldn't that make things easier? Shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't I be better?!” Questioning himself bitterly he continues, oblivious to Karlach and Wyll trying to cautiously grab his attention, “How could this still happen? Alfira was knocked out! I just—can't I stop this? How—why did this happen? Why is any of this—?! I shouldn't—I shouldn't even be here! I fucking—I died! Over and over!” Kneeling hunched over, hands locked behind his head, he tries to pull himself down smaller and smaller. Hopelessly consumed by the crushing weight of everything, wishing to disappear within himself. He's gasping for air, barely able to get any words out, “If I can’t—let me forget! So fucking tired—haven't I—isn't this enough? Don't I deserve peace?! Don't they? Please, gods—I can't—” Unexpectedly—miraculously?—it simply… stops. The panic. The fear. The doom. Every crushing emotion that's been dominating him, driving him to the brink, suddenly dulled to a quiet lull. Xander blinks in surprise, releasing the hold on himself and carefully sitting back on his heels. Shadowheart is a few feet away, talking about ‘something working’, seeming to have cast a spell. Before he could hear whatever it was that she said, an incredible wave of relief washes over him—followed by an unstoppable need to both cry and sleep. Xander tries to thank Shadowheart—for whatever she has done—that has provided him with such a reprieve. However, the internal war of desired emotional release and desperately needed rest is too great; his mouth moves through the motions, but all that comes out is a soft, content sigh as he collapses. His body's need for sleep won, Xander falling unconscious before he even hit the ground. A few tears escaped his tired eyes, now rolling down his blood-stained face.
