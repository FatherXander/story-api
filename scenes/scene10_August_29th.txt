### Scene 10: August 29th

Astarion’s POV: Astarion watches Xander being revived by Withers. Withers works that otherworldly magic and, of course, Xander’s lifeless corpse is brought back to life. His eyes narrow slightly as he observes Xander's oddly subdued reaction to being brought back to life. The way Xander jolts upright, gasps, then simply lies back down, staring blankly at the sky. What an odd way to react to being given another chance at life, he thinks, tilting his head, his curiosity piqued. He is used to people fearing death and even more so to being overly grateful when escaping it, but Xander’s reaction... It's too calm. Almost indifferent. He keeps his eyes on Xander as Karlach approaches him, her form partially obscuring Xander from view. He catches glimpses of their conversation but can't make out much beyond their tones. Karlach’s gesture toward him, Xander’s reactive words, "Absolutely not!"—he can hear the sudden raise in Xander’s voice, the tension in the air almost palpable. It seems whatever Karlach had suggested involved him. His gaze sharpens, lips thinning slightly. What could she possibly want with me that has him so flustered? When Karlach finally leaves, his eyes linger on Xander, watching the bard reluctantly heal a burn and then stand up. The bard’s demeanor is still off. The distance between them allows him a brief moment of contemplation. Xander died. I drained him dry. And yet, here he is again, seemingly no worse for wear—physically, at least. A flicker of something—annoyance, perhaps frustration—flashes in his eyes. How can he be so calm about all of this? He keeps doing these unexpected things, saying those things that make no sense. Just what game is he playing at? He doesn’t have much longer to ponder as Xander begins to approach him directly. He squares his shoulders subtly, keeping his expression neutral, aloof.

Xander’s POV: Xander approaches Astarion, offering a smile and nod of his acknowledgment. “Good morning, my dear,” he greets quietly. Without missing a beat, he tilts his head and asks, genuinely curious, “So, how was it? Sinking your teeth into a 'thinking creature' for the first time, I mean.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s mouth pulls into a sharp smile. There’s an edge to his eyes—something darker, more defensive. His gaze narrows as he chuckles, soft and mocking. “Oh, darling, you certainly know how to get straight to the point, don't you?” he begins—deflecting, of course. He leans in slightly, his eyes fixed on Xander’s face, studying every miniscule reaction. “And what if I enjoyed it? What if I found it... exhilarating?” The question hangs between them. His smile becomes more predatory, though the underlying uncertainty remains.

Xander’s POV: Xander breathes out a laugh and glances aside. Amusement dances along his expression as more laughter filters out of him. “Hells, I would surely hope so. It wouldn't make sense otherwise,” he replies in a bemused, lighthearted manner, then shakes his head and turns his face aside. “'What if'. Gods,” he echoes to himself in an almost incredulous tone, another short, amused laugh escaping him. Looking back at Astarion, his smile softens—but his eyes take on a perceptive, piercing glint. Leaning in close, he fixes his unrelenting gaze on Astarion. He lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, his tone candid. “I understand you don't appreciate my lack of reaction, Astarion. But I'm not afraid of you. Never have been and never will be.” His eyes flicker between Astarion’s, the smile on his features growing just a touch more. Moving closer to whisper in Astarion’s ear, his lips are only a breath away from brushing against Astarion’s skin, he murmurs sincerely, “I am, however, afraid of losing you.” A faint chuckle escapes him as he straightens his posture and steps back. He gestures at Astarion vaguely with a flick of his wrist, then folds his arms—teasing in a nonchalant manner. “So, there you have it. No need to be cranky just because I adore you as you are.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion swallows, feeling a chill run through him. He’s afraid of losing me? What? After I literally killed him last night? He cannot be serious. His eyes flicker, a mix of defensiveness and confusion swelling within him. Xander steps back, arms folding, those teasing words hanging in the air. He clenches his jaw slightly, trying to regain his composure. Letting out a slow breath, he offers a smirk—sharp, but lacking the ease of his usual charm. “You are a peculiar one, aren’t you?” he purrs, his voice low, though a slight edge of hesitation slips through. He takes a step forward; his eyes fixed on Xander’s. “To speak of such... tender feelings, and yet, so casually.” He arches a brow and tilts his head, masking the uncertainty within. “Are you trying to soften me, darling? Because if so…” he murmurs in a smooth tone and leans in, his lips brushing near Xander’s ear, “…it might just be working.”

Xander’s POV: Xander jolts, startled and caught completely off guard. A surprised, breathless laugh escapes him. He reactively rests his hand on Astarion’s arm, a seemingly subconscious reaction, while he briefly turns his face aside. Flustered laughter continues spilling out of him before his gaze—now narrowed playfully—snaps back to meet Astarion’s. “Astarion,” he breathes, his accusatory whisper soft like a sigh, “don't—don't do that.” He breaks eye-contact and turns his face away again, though the flustered grin on his lips refuses to budge. With an amused, self-deprecating laugh, he admits playfully, “I already 'like' you a bit too much. I don't need help to like you more.” Then, leaning in just a bit closer, he lilts flirtatiously. “And I'm not trying to soften you, by the way. But I'm also not complaining, either way.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion lets the silence linger just long enough for it to become uncomfortable before a slow, predatory smile creeps across his lips. “Is that so?” he whispers back, his voice barely above a murmur, each word enunciated with deliberate care, “If you like me too much already… then perhaps you should be more careful about getting too close.” He holds Xander’s gaze for another beat, allowing his smile to soften just a fraction—a faint, almost imperceptible shift that betrays a moment of genuine curiosity. “But,” he continues, “I suppose I do enjoy your boldness. It’s... refreshing, in a way.” Straightening slightly, he steps back, his gaze flickering down to where Xander’s hand still rests on his arm. He glances back up at Xander, one eyebrow arched. “Now, would you mind?” He tilts his head, lips curling into a teasing smile. “I’d hate for anyone else to get the wrong impression—thinking I’m growing soft, or worse, attached.” He chuckles, the sound trailing off as he regards Xander with a mix of wariness and intrigue. Though his words are playful, there is an underlying tension—something he can’t quite shake off. His eyes linger on Xander’s face for a moment longer than intended before he clears his throat and gestures vaguely toward the rest of the camp. “Besides, we have work to do, don’t we? Can’t afford to spend all day making eyes at one another—no matter how delightful it might be.”

Xander’s POV: Withdrawing his hand, Xander steps back and exhales a dramatically resigned sigh. Looking aside, he concedes with feigned disappointment—subtly underlined by genuine disappointment at the prospect, “Alright fine.” He glances back at Astarion, offering the rogue a teasing smile. “I'll still have a delightful time keeping my eyes on you, though.” With that, he fully steps out of Astarion’s space and concludes with a simple, “Off we go, then.” And so, with the morning behind them, the party—Xander, Astarion, Gale, and Wyll—set off to 'work'. Unlike the previous couple days, they found themselves busy with battles, having ventured into the Blighted Village. Xander relayed valuable information to Astarion, Gale, and Wyll before they entered, explaining that there was a dozen or more goblins and worgs within, some readying an ambush near one of the entrances. He suggested a game plan, the four of them bouncing ideas off of each other until they settle on the best course of action. Xander led them to an entrance that's ‘off the beaten path,’ giving them a better advantage. They carry on with relative ease, taking out a drunk, sleeping bugbear (thanks to Astarion), and the handful of goblins readying the (unsuccessful) ambush. Moving along, one of the goblins guarding the village happens to spot them and question them, though Xander—with his 'bard ways', deceives them with ease, claiming that the four of them belong there. With the attention drawn off of them, they sneak around on the rooftops and pick off the remaining goblins patrolling around, before moving into position to take out the large group of goblins and worgs tormenting a deep gnome that they (the goblins) tied to a windmill. Xander notes that it's Barcus tied to the windmill, someone who he's quite fond of, and will eventually join them in their adventure. He remarks how he's not only ‘very funny,’ but also loyal, and will trade goods with them and provide a rare explosive further in their journey. With that, they engage in a battle with the goblins/worgs, a fight that's won rather easily despite how outnumbered the party was, thanks to the advantageous position and knowledge that they wouldn't otherwise possess. They make their way to the windmill, pull a break level to cease its movements, and free Barcus. Barcus briefly chats with them, wary at first (Xander is half-drow, and drow are known to keep deep gnomes as slaves in the Underdark), but after Xander reassures him he's not there to enslave him, Barcus explains how/why he got caught by the goblins, noting that he had a heavy backpack full of supplies that slowed him down. Barcus tells the party the location of said pack, and that it's all theirs—he isn't interested in risking getting caught again. Before departing, Barcus adds, “Well. If we meet again, then we will have... met again.” The party retrieves his pack (inside there's smoke powder, food, and a few other valuables), but before they leave, Xander mentions wanting to do something that's more on the 'fun side'. He leads them to a barn, just outside the village, requesting Gale and Wyll hideout on the rooftop as there will be a 'small, yet rather troublesome' fight. Once they're on top of the rooftop, Xander and Astarion approach the door, the sounds of two 'creatures' getting 'frisky' within. As Xander is about to open the door, Astarion comments on them sounding utterly disgusting; and that he himself wants to be the one to interrupt. Xander allows Astarion the honor, and upon Astarion opening the door, they find there's a bugbear and ogre found within, engaging in an 'intimate activity'. Xander and Astarion get a kick out of not only the sight before them, but also the reaction of them interrupting that they garnered. Xander makes a comment about their act being written into ‘smut,’ which effectively destroys the moment and embarrasses the bugbear and ogre, who leave the barn. However, just as they have their back turned, Xander abruptly attacks them—thus, commencing a fight. Thanks to Gale and Wyll hiding out on the rooftop, they have a decent advantage, even though the ogre proves to be a bit of a problem (given their strength and high constitution/health). Yet again though, the party comes out on top. After they loot the area and return to camp, Xander speaks to Gale, who conveys his need for a magical item. Xander gives him one without hesitation, taking a moment to chat with him before making his rounds to check in on the rest of the companions. As the early evening passes, the companions retire for the night.
