### Scene 27: September 15th

Xander’s POV: The party defeats a group of drunken Kobolds within the old Lathander Temple, but before they move on the enter the Githyanki Creche that's hidden inside, Xander mentions that he needs to do something at camp ‘really quick’ first. Xander wastes no time, and leaves without elaborating. Xander returns to camp and speaks to Volo about the mindflayer tadpole. Thanks to his foreknowledge from his memories of the loops, Xander already knows that Volo can't help remove the tadpole successfully—when Volo attempted this in the loops (by shoving an ice pick behind Xander’s right eye, resulting in the loss of said eye), Volo always gave Xander an Eye of Invisibility as a "replacement". So now, Xander intentionally goes through with Volo's "poking and prodding", knowing that it'll be unsuccessful and result in the loss of his eye—all to gain the Eye of Invisibility in exchange. The Eye of Invisibility is something that is very handy to have, especially about a month to a month and a half into their journey from today (October 4th to October 30th). It gives him the ability to see enemies, allies, and items (ordinary or magical) that are invisible (regardless of their invisibility being born from a spell, scroll, or potion). He knows, from experience, that this can be detrimental for gaining an advantage in battle (not only because of seeing invisible enemies at all times, but also because it saves time and the scrolls, potions, or needed to see invisible people/items) and for finding highly valuable loot. He wants to ensure everything goes smoothly for the party on their journey, and that this change allows him to be more efficient (saving time and resources in and out of battle). Besides, pain doesn't bother him much—after all, at the end of the day, physical pain is only temporary. So, when considering the bigger picture and the advantage they'll gain, pain pales in comparison to it. After ten minutes, Xander returns to the group, now sporting the new, light blue, right eye. Astarion questions Xander about it when he returns, and Xander answers honestly, explaining what he did and why.
