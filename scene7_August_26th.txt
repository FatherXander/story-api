### Scene 7: August 26th

Xander’s POV: Xander seems more at ease—thanks to his admission of the time loops/bhaalspawn identity, which relieved an unbearable amount of tension—which is reflected in his lightened attitude today. And, well, getting more sleep definitely helped as well, of course. Given that everyone knows now, Xander is open with what he knows when it comes to the area they're exploring, locations of interest, where to find valuables and/or useful items, and enemies to look out for. And, as promised, he leads the party to the forgotten temple. Using his 'bardic ways,' Xander deceives the looters outside the Temple, 'warning' them of monsters that lurk within the crashed vessel nearby. The looters leave the area, abandoning their comrades within the Temple. It makes the ensuing fight a bit more manageable, given the decreased number of targets. Astarion lockpicks their way inside and the party ambushes the people inside. After they loot the area that the looters had taken over, Xander locates the (not so hidden) hidden lever, the skull, and unlocks the door that leads further within the Temple. Upon entering, he then leads them to the trapped room with a large Sarcophagus. Astarion disarms it as the rest of the party retrieves the loot. After Astarion disarms the trap and retrieves the key (for the room that holds Withers), the party enters said room. The tall, crumbling space looks like a center stage for the large statue of Jergal—situated perfectly in front of the far wall. Xander recommends different hiding spots for everyone, pointing of the various dead scribes that will reanimate as soon as he opens a door. Sure enough, after everyone is hiding and in position, Xander clicks the button. The wall next to it lowers and the skeletons rise—determined to attack Xander (which works in the party's favor, as Xander basically bait). Given that this current journey is the first and only time Xander has had foreknowledge of what's to come, he can't help but be a little theatrical about. A true bard, even if a traumatized one, clearly. Xander lets out a gasp, feigning surprise, goading the enemy as he dryly retorts aloud to himself, “Oh, no, a group of geriatric bones! Whatever shall I do?” The hidden party members ambush the skeletons, giving the party the advantage, and everyone works together to defeat the undead with relative ease. Regrouping, they enter the hidden room and find a giant Sarcophagus—the one containing Withers. As soon as Xander begins to move the cover, his hand barely touching the lid of the Sarcophagus—Withers' hand reaches out and pushes it open. Withers levitates out of it and makes the same cryptic remark he always does. Xander suppresses a smile, trying to not show how happy he is to see Withers—someone he's rather amused by, and that he admires/respects. When Withers asks Xander his cryptic question about the 'worth of a single mortal's life,' Xander answers the same as always—even though now (unlike every other time) he knows the outcome, and could technically say something different or outlandish, he doesn't. He replies sincerely, saying, “Every life is of infinite value, and merits sacrificing everything for.” Withers, satisfied with the answer, gives his cryptic reply about 'balance,' and that he'll see the party again at the proper time and place. With that, the party gathers loot lying around within the Temple, and decides to call it a day. Back at camp, they discover that not only has Withers joined them, but Scratch as well. Xander greets the bestest boy Scratch by giving him lots of pets—naturally—and then briefly converses with Withers. Withers relays that he'll be there if they require assistance for revival purposes and such. As everyone settles in for the evening, partaking in personal routines or light conversation with one another, Xander spends his time with Scratch by the fire. Despite it being the end of the day, he drinks a potion of Animal Speaking (which gives him the ability to understand Scratch and have an actual conversation with him) and talks with the pup. Xander quietly asks questions how Scratch is doing, if he needs anything, what his favorite foods/toys are, what Scratch’s previous master liked to do with him, etc., pets him, brushes him—and even asks permission before removing Scratch’s collar to brush the fur beneath it—all the while being genuinely engaged. Seemingly content, laughing, almost peaceful.
