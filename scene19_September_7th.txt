### Scene 19: September 7th

Xander’s POV: Xander, on most nights, would be busy checking in on the group at this time. Filling the nighttime air with light chatter. Instead, he's found hunched over a writing desk, focused on a personal task. This carries on for the entire evening, hours passing with Xander still diligently working away. Most of the companions were in bed by the time he finally finished, the exceptions being Astarion—naturally. And Wyll—a bit 'unnaturally,' but not in a bad way, obviously. Shortly after wrapping up his 'work', Xander makes his way to Astarion, offering him the usual small nod and smile in acknowledgment. His exhaustion is more evident than it has been in the past week or so, the lack of sleep lately is now visibly catching up to him. His expression, however, is relaxed. Calm. “Good evening, my dear,” he murmurs, his greeting is faint and warm, the curious glint in his gaze evident. “I wanted to give you something before you turn in for the night. If you don't mind, that is?”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion considers the man in front of him. Xander’s greeting is expected, but the question that follows is not expected. He blinks once, slow and deliberate, like a cat catching sight of something it doesn’t yet understand. Give me something? The sheer foreignness of that phrase, coming from someone who has already given so much. His posture shifts, not quite cautious, not quite receptive. Curious. Caught somewhere in between. “Oh?” he replies, softly now, the teasing edge tucked beneath silk instead of on display. “You look positively dreadful, my dear, and yet still find the energy to play the gallant gift-giver?” His voice lowers slightly, private now, like a secret just between the two of them. “I don’t mind,” he says at last, with a mockingly delicate shrug. “So long as it’s not another riddle, or gods forbid, a moral lesson disguised as a sentimental token. My cold, dead heart can only take so much.”

Xander’s POV: A grin blooms on Xander’s sleep deprived features. He clicks his tongue, feigning disappointment—though his amusement is clear as day. “Well, shit,” he remarks playfully, “But I like riddles and moral lessons, love. How unfair of you.” He laughs, the rough sounding mirth trickling out of him. Quietly clearing his throat, he shakes his head and takes a step closer. His voice dips, the low pitch exacerbating its gravelly quality. “Luckily for you, this 'positively dreadful' looking gift-giver has something infinitely better. Something worth time and effort, so perhaps a little sentimental.” Taking another step closer, he pauses to pull out his journal. He then continues, shamelessly soft. “I've been thinking about how you haven't seen your own face in two centuries, thanks to your vampiric affliction. And while I know this isn't the same as a mirror,” he opens the cover of the journal, revealing some loose papers within, “you deserve to see yourself, one way or another.” He gives Astarion the papers. Drawn with graphite, four realism portraits of Astarion adorn the pages. The drawings of Astarion are candid and flattering in their depiction. There's small, quickly written notes around the edges of each portrait—details pertaining to the place, dates, and 'observations'. The 'place' in relation to the portrait, with one of the portrait's completion dates going back as far as a week ago. His 'observations' are notes on Astarion’s features, the composition of the drawing, Astarion’s expression, and compliments on Astarion's beauty, of course.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion does not take the papers immediately. No—he stares. Stares at Xander as though the man has grown a second head, or perhaps torn open Astarion’s chest and set something trembling loose inside. Drawings? Realism, no less. Of him. Four separate portraits, captured in graphite, as if Astarion were some tragic noble immortalized in a lord’s hall. Not stylized caricatures, not embellished fantasy—no, these are real. Too real. Intimately observant, delicately flattering. Every line of his jaw, every furrow of mischief or melancholy that might crease his brow—seen. All of it, seen. The notes catch his eye next. Casual scribbles of place and date, yes, but also—compliments. Observations. Admiration. He blinks. Once. Again. His hands hover near the pages but do not yet touch them. It feels, for a moment, like they might burn him. “Gods,” he murmurs. “You really have gone mad.” The words are soft. Uncharacteristically gentle. Not laced with venom, nor sarcasm, though his tone flickers with that nervous tremor he despises—the kind that gives away more than he wants it to. He glances up at Xander, his expression unreadable save for the thinnest crack along his mask. “And here I was, prepared to find some trinket or bauble in your hands. Not… this. Not something so…” He trails off. ‘Not something so…’ so what, Astarion? Intimate? Undeserved? Disarming? His throat tightens. The part of him that survived on charm and weaponized allure wants to joke, wants to leer, to let a sly little grin curl at his lips and toss a jest like 'I am devastatingly handsome, aren’t I?', but the words refuse to form. It feels—wrong. Cheap. And he’s suddenly, acutely aware of how real the moment is. He finally reaches out, gingerly accepting the papers, careful not to smudge the graphite. He studies one—just one—and swallows hard. It’s him, but not as the world sees him. Not as a monster or a pretty puppet. It’s him as Xander sees him. And that… that’s something he hasn’t dared imagine in centuries. Not since he lost the right to his own reflection. “I don’t…” he begins, but the sentence doesn’t know how to end. He stares at the portrait again. The detail around the eyes, the gentle curve of his expression. Affection. Not worship. Not mockery. Just… truth. A pause. He looks up again, slower this time, meeting Xander’s eyes fully. There’s no performance now. No act. No mask. “You gave me back my face,” he says at last, the weight of it startlingly quiet. “You…” He breathes in sharply, glancing down. “Gods damn you, you sentimental bastard.” And then he laughs. Breathless and broken, a little too high, too near hysterical. But real. “I should be furious,” he says. “You watched me, studied me without asking. Drew me without my permission. That’s terribly invasive, you know.” But his voice is shaking now. With what? Gratitude? Relief? Fear of what it means to be seen so fully? He presses his lips together, fighting for composure. “…Thank you.” His thanks is barely above a whisper. But the sincerity in it is unmistakable.

Xander’s POV: Xander smiles, faint and fond. He breathes in deeply, then exhales a long, drawn-out sigh. The exhaustion hits him even harder now, but now in a bad way—more like a 'finally able to rest' kind of way. Truly content. Leaning in, he lightly rests his hand on Astarion’s shoulder and whispers quietly, sincerely, “Anytime, my love.” His touch lingers for a moment before he reluctantly pulls back, his half-lidded gaze feeling heavier by the second. “You’re welcome to feed on me tonight, if you'd like. I can't promise I'll wake up, so you can just bite me in my sleep,” he remarks with a lethargic laugh. With a slight bow of his head, he adds, “I'll see you tomorrow if not tonight. Good night, Astarion.” Offering one last smile, he departs, heading off to bed.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion feels Xander’s departure as if it were a living thing in the air. The portraits are still in his hands, graphite ghosts of a reflection long denied. His face, rendered with such painstaking care and reverent detail, stares back at him. Not once. Four times. Four versions of a man he can barely admit to being. You gave me back my face. Gods. He said that out loud, didn’t he? And Xander—Xander had just smiled at him, calm and warm, as if he hadn’t just bared himself so nakedly. As if such a gesture wasn’t earth-shatteringly tender. As if gifting him these renderings, this impossible reclamation of identity, was as natural as breathing. He sinks down onto the nearest flat stone, the papers trembling ever so slightly in his hands. He’s furious. No. That’s not the right word. Exposed—yes, that’s closer. Unraveled, undone, unmasked. Gods, how he hates how easily Xander can do that to him. With no magic. No manipulation. Just... sincerity. And that wretched, maddening patience. His crimson eyes scan one of the portraits again. The way the light has been shaded around the jaw. The small note in the margin, 'Eyes narrowed at Lae’zel’s nonsense. Can’t tell if it’s disdain or amusement. Beautiful either way.' He lets out a short, breathless laugh. “Disdain, obviously,” he mutters. But even he doesn’t believe it. The intimacy of it claws at him—to have been observed so closely, so earnestly, without knowing. It strikes somewhere deep, where no blade has touched in two centuries. Not even Cazador carved this far in. No chains had ever reached so neatly into the hollows of him. No lover—not that any of them had truly seen him. Only the mask. The performance. The predator or the prey. But Xander... Gods damn the bard. He clutches the pages close to his chest, folding in over them like he’s shielding a wound. Or hiding a treasure. Maybe both. His mind races, panicked thoughts crashing into each other. What does this mean? What does he want from me? What am I supposed to do with this? He’s never been given something like this—something just because. Xander had said, "Anytime, my love." He should be suspicious. He is suspicious. This could be a trick. A performance. But... it doesn’t feel like one. And that’s the most terrifying part. And then there’s that offhanded comment Xander had left him with, "You can bite me in my sleep." As if that were nothing. As if that, too, was a gift to be given freely. Xander trusts me. Unconditionally. His tips his head back, eyes toward the star-pricked sky. It’s unbearable. It’s too much. And yet, he doesn’t run. He doesn’t toss the drawings into the fire. He doesn’t retreat behind flirtation or mockery or wrath. Instead, he folds the papers carefully, reverently, and tucks them away into his pack—wrapped in cloth, safe. Hidden. Mine, he thinks, fierce and possessive. A beat passes. Then another. And finally, he stands, smooth and soundless as ever. He does not follow Xander—not yet. But his eyes linger toward the direction the bard disappeared in, his expression unreadable, save for one fragile thread woven through the quiet stillness.
