### Scene 21: September 9th

Xander’s POV: The party is busy in the Underdark running around. Xander speaks with the Myconid leader, Spaw, and agrees to avenge their people (many of the Myconids at this colony were slaughtered recently, children and elders alike). The party is tasked with killing some Duergar at the Underdark beach. Despite the fact that the Duergar are invisible, Xander (as always, thanks to his memories of the loops) knows where they are. Well, approximately. Taking position at a highly advantageous point, a very tall cliffside that overlooks the beach, he and the party crouch low. He explains that there’s only three of them, but the ‘main’ Duergar they have to look out for will resurrect the dead bodies littering the beach. Not that it makes any difference, mind. They’re so high up that the animated bodies, the ‘zombies,’ will be utterly useless. Even the Duergar themselves will be lucky to hit them. So, he points out the areas on the beach where they can expect the Duergar to be, and notes that there’s one Duergar hiding behind one of the desolate buildings. That one can be a pain in the ass, but once the fight commences, it won’t be long before the bastard tries to hit one of them and loses invisibility. Once everything is explained, they concoct a plan and get to work. Xander pulls out some Alchemist’s Fire, everyone taking one. Then, aiming for the area’s he pointed out, they toss the fire explosives. Sure enough, two Duergar appear, their invisibility spell having been broken. Without skipping a beat, they jump into action. They manage to kill the ‘main’ Duergar right away, thus avoiding a “rather boring clean-up”. They steadily attack the second Duergar without a hitch until the third finally makes a move and attacks them. The damn coward is having hidden inside a ruined building, making it more difficult for the party to land a hit. But, of course, the bastard can’t stay hidden forever. As half the party focuses on the second Duergar, the third Duergar goes out into the open to try and attack. The other half of the party beats him to the punch and launches their own attack. The fight wraps up fairly quickly, proving to be yet another smooth success. After taking a short rest, Xander suggests that they retrieve the Sussar bark (it’s needed to complete a specialty weapon that they found blueprints for a little over a week ago). The Sussar tree is on the cliff that they’re on, directly behind them. A giant, glorious tree with light blue leaves that glow brightly in the dark. The surrounding area is bathed in the pale light, giving this part of the Underdark an ethereal air to it. Unfortunately, though, there’s a Hook Horror nest near the place they’ll need to go in order to access the bark. Thus, they make a quick walk around the massive tree and settle into the most advantageous spot. There’s three Hook Horrors hanging around, along with a crazed wizard that lives with them. Two of the Hook Horrors are ‘patrolling’ and keeping watch close to where the party is hiding. These monsters will call out for ‘reinforcements’ (the other Hook Horrors and the crazed wizard) once the fight starts, if given the chance to do so. Xander informs the party of what attacks work most effectively against them, and that stealth is detrimental. It can be gnarly fight if they’re not careful. With gallows humor, he mentions having “many unpleasant memories” of being killed by these “ugly, vicious bastards”, and that he'd like to avoid it this time. The party creates a plan and puts it into action. They do their best to isolate one Hook Horror at a time, just narrowly managing to kill them without the monster’s warning call alerting the others. Once the Hook Horrors and the crazed wizard are dead, Xander and a few party members walk up a path-sized branch of the Sussar tree and retrieve the bark. Given all the fighting they’ve done today, they decide to hold off creating the Sussar weapon. Xander also mentions that it’d be best to tell the Spaw tomorrow that they killed the Duergar, as there’s a certain Myconid in the colony that will request to follow the party and witness the Duergar’s corpses in person. This Myconid, Glut, was once a leader in their own colony. However, Glut’s colony seems to have recently perished, for one reason or another. Xander explains that Glut is a “cowardly, thankless bastard” that intends to ask the party to kill Spaw (so that Glut can take Spaw’s place). So, that can definitely wait just one more day. They party then heads back to camp and rests for the night.
