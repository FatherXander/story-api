### Scene 6: August 25th

Xander’s POV: Xander sleeps the majority of the day away, finally getting proper rest for the first time in almost a week. Upon waking, the companions confront Xander over Quill's death and the escalating problems he's been having. The companions muse over the tadpole influencing Xander’s actions, and that its influence might be why he killed Quill. Xander remains silent, clearly uncomfortable. But, as the companions press, asking why he did it and why he was so broken up over Quill's death, he eventually caves—and makes a reluctant confession. “I was upset because what happened with Quill—that… that shouldn't have been possible. I—we—have all done this before. ‘This’ being our journey. From being kidnapped by ilithids, to searching for a cure together, and finally finding said cure. Multiple times, from beginning to end. Like a time loop, for lack of a better term,” he explains earnestly, a sense of unease settling in on his features. He pauses, searching for the right words to express the situation they're in. With a sigh, he continues, “We've been unknowingly doing this over and over again. We'd reach the end of this, and all of the sudden, we're back at the beginning again. Everyone's minds—including mine—completely wiped. And now, for the first time, the reality of what's been happening didn't get erased. On August 20th, when I woke up on the beach after the crash, I just… I don't know. I suddenly remembered everything. I don't understand why no one else remembers, though.” Gesturing vaguely with his hand as if to encapsulate their journey as a whole, he frowns slightly and wraps up his explanation. “This is why I know the area, the people, the enemies, and the item locations—everything—so intimately. And Quill—she should've never come here. She never has. Usually, a bard from the Grove, Alfira, shows up. I was worried that what happened last night would happen again, so I incapacitated her in hopes of saving her. And yet... Quill, quite literally, came from nowhere anyway.” He looks aside and folds his arms, lips rolling together to fight off a grimace. The effort to do so is unsuccessful. It's obvious that he's expecting judgment not only for the time loop explanation, but also the why of it all: “The 'urge' I have isn't just a dark temptation to kill—it's what I was forced to be. A mortal child of Bhaal. An unwilling one at that, which pisses him off. Clearly.”

Gale’s POV: Gale steps forward first, brows furrowed in stunned contemplation. “A time loop?” he repeats, voice low, but not mocking—curious. “You’ve lived through all of this before?” His eyes dart between the others. “Then Quill's death wasn’t just tragic—it was a variable. An anomaly. That’s why you were panicked. Gods…” He exhales, dragging a hand through his hair. “But how can we verify this? Not that I doubt your sincerity—but surely you must understand how absurd this sounds.” His tone is careful, but not cold.

Wyll’s POV: Wyll crosses his arms slowly, staring hard at Xander. “So, you knew the path,” he says, quieter, “and you still ended up covered in her blood.” His expression isn’t accusatory, just hurt. “You tried to save her… and it still happened. That doesn’t sound like madness. That sounds like being cursed.”

Karlach’s POV: Karlach mutters, “Hells… no wonder you looked like death warmed over all week.” She paces briefly. “I don’t know what to believe, but—damn. You weren’t lying when you said you were trying to protect us.” She shoots a glance to Shadowheart, nodding toward Xander. “I mean, he looks like he’s barely held together with spit and string.”

Shadowheart’s POV: Shadowheart tilts her head slightly, studying Xander with suspicion and concern in equal measure. “You say you remember everything—then why not tell us sooner? You waited until after Quill was dead. What if we’re next?” Her voice sharpens slightly, not in cruelty, but in instinctual defense. “How can we be sure this isn’t the tadpole whispering lies in your head, bending your truth to suit its ends?”

Lae'zel’s POV: Lae'zel—who until now has been unusually quiet—scoffs under her breath, a sharp, humorless laugh escaping. “A loop. A weakness. He bleeds, weeps, breaks. I say we kill him and see if the gods grant us another timeline.” Her hand hovers over her weapon, but she doesn’t draw it—merely tests the threat in the air.

Xander’s POV: Xander blinks, struggling to mentally digest the barrage of questions, the influx of everyone's opinions on the manner. His body, initially tense, gradually relaxes. Uncrossing his arms, he attempts to consider it all. But, his thoughts snag—stuck on Lae'zel's threat. His gaze flicks to her weapon, and as it does, his brows crease in genuine consideration. Thoughtful and sincere. “Another timeline...” he repeats to himself softly, the proverbial wheels visibly turning. With a flick of his wrist, he gestures at Lae'zel's weapon and candidly replies, “It's worth a try. You won't know if it'll work until the end of this, but we've gotten through it all within two and a half months before, so...” A pause. His face then lights up, a contemplative hum slipping past his lips. He makes his way over to his personal items, murmuring, “But before you do that... I want to provide you guys with information.” He casually reaches down, retrieves his journal, and stands. He opens his journal and begins writing, sinking into a focused state with ease. “I should be dead anyway, and you all should be about a decade past this, so... maybe it'll work? As long as you kill me and don't revive me, obviously,” he remarks candidly, his voice dropping to a softer tone as he mumbles before trailing off, “Just... bear with me for a moment, please. There's so much you need to know...”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion listens, his expression cool and unreadable at first as Xander speaks. The confession—that they are trapped in some sort of loop—that they've lived through this before… well, that strikes a nerve. A nerve Astarion isn't quite ready to admit exists. Of course. Of course this broken, haunted little bard has a secret even more twisted than the rest of us combined. A loop. A repetition. How poetically cruel. To live the same suffering over and over again—how utterly like fate to curse someone so thoroughly… and how terribly suspicious. His crimson eyes narrow subtly as Xander speaks of remembering everything. Of having loved and lost, multiple times over. That explains so much—the eyes that flinch when Astarion gets too close, the knowing look when he feigned ignorance of the boar, the way he whispered apologies in his sleep, the damned vision—or, gods, was it actually a memory?—when their tadpoles connected during their meeting at the beach. Something cold twists in his gut, akin to that of dread. He distracts himself by watching the others respond.

Karlach’s POV: Karlach paces, her mechanical heart audibly whirring with the force of her tension. “You weren’t lying,” she mutters, repeating her earlier sentiment. “You actually meant it when you said you were trying to protect us. Shit. You died for us, didn’t you?” Her voice cracks slightly, but she plays it off, eyes scanning the others. “Time loop or no, the man looks like he’s been dragged through every layer of the Hells.”

Wyll’s POV: Wyll’s jaw clenches. “You should’ve told us, Xander,” he says, not unkindly, but firmly. “We could’ve helped you carry some of this. I don’t know if I believe all of it—but you kept this to yourself until after Quill died.”

Lae'zel’s POV: “She died because of him,” Lae’zel snaps, hand hovering again over her weapon. “And now he offers himself up as if that will solve anything? Foolish. If death is the answer, let us try it then. Cut the thread and start anew.”

Gale’s POV: Gale, ever the intellectual, shakes his head slowly. With a level headed tone, he says, “No. No, we can’t leap to that. We need to understand this, verify it. If what he says is true, and he remembers things that haven’t happened yet… that could save thousands. Xander, you said you know things—prove it. Tell us something that’ll happen tomorrow. Something verifiable.”

Xander’s POV: Xander’s hand stills, his eyes flicking over to Gale with an engaged and interested expression. Lowering the journal, he points at Gale with his quill and murmurs thoughtfully, “What a good idea.” Slowly, he closes his journal, temporarily abandoning it and the quill on the ground. He walks over to Gale, tapping his temple with the faintest of smiles playing on his lips, “Better yet, I can even show you, thanks to these fucking worms.” He drops his hand, gaze sweeping over everyone with a curious gaze. “And as for not tell you sooner, it wasn't because I didn't want to. I assumed either no one would believe me, no one would trust me, or I'd lose you. And, let's be real: would any of you followed me if I—a stranger, in your eyes—said that I knew you? Not just the choices you made in the future, but intimately? We all have secrets here. I highly doubt that would've gone well.”

Lae’zel's POV: Lae’zel’s hand twitches by her weapon again, sharp gaze flicking between the others, then back to Xander. “He offers memories as proof,” she sneers, “as if visions and dreams haven’t already lied to us.” She scoffs, stepping forward. “He said he remembers our choices—intimately.” Her tone lingers with suspicion and disdain. “If that were true, he would know better than to withhold such knowledge. We should not entertain more illusions.”

Karlach’s POV: Karlach bristles, shoulders stiff. “And what, you think killing him helps anyone?” she growls, eyes narrowing on Lae’zel. “He looks like he’s barely hanging on as it is—he’s not asking for trust, he’s offering answers. Which is more than you ever give.”

Gale’s POV: Gale interjects, hand lifted diplomatically. “Let’s not reduce this to infighting. Lae’zel raises a fair concern—even memories can be faulty. But if Xander can show us something that will happen—verifiably—it could change everything.” He turns to Xander again. “If you can show us that... it might ground this in something other than just madness.”

Shadowheart’s POV: Shadowheart folds her arms, eyes sharp. “He says he didn’t tell us because he thought we wouldn’t believe him.” Her gaze cuts to Karlach and then Gale. “Well, we don’t. Not yet. But I also saw his face when he saw Quill’s body. That wasn’t just guilt. That was grief. Something happened to him—that much is clear.”

Wyll’s POV: Wyll speaks up from the side, more quietly. “We’ve all seen pain, but not like this.” He’s watching Xander carefully now, almost haunted. “If what you’re saying is true… and we’ve done this before—that means I’ve known you before. Fought beside you. Trusted you. And I’ve forgotten all of it?” He shakes his head slowly. “It explains a lot. But it also makes me feel sick.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion chuckles softly, his voice like a blade wrapped in silk. “Gods, what a tragedy,” he murmurs, stepping out of the shadows he’s leaned into during the argument. “A man doomed to live the same story over and over again, knowing exactly how it ends, unable to stop it. Almost romantic.” He tilts his head, studying Xander. “And you—weeping through your sleep, whispering my name like a lover’s ghost.” His tone sharpens, though the smile stays. “You say you know us. So, tell me, then—what am I to you, Xander?” His question cuts through the tension like a knife. “Am I the monster you fear? The one you mourn? Or am I just another pawn in your little story?”

Xander’s POV: A stunned silence that falls over the group as Astarion's questions hang in the air—and Xander is not immune. He stares at the rogue, unblinking, genuinely caught off guard. A beat passes before he exhales faintly, the startled expression on his face softening ever so slightly. “You're Astarion,” he replies, his voice quiet and unembellished, “Who you are is 'what' you are to me. It's impossible to see you as anything less than that.” His gaze drifts over everyone, his face softening with a pensive mindfulness. “You all mean a lot to me, honestly.” He breathes in deep, chest rising and falling with a long sigh. “Listen, I... I get that this is strange, to put it very mildly. I dislike this just as much as you do. If not for the invaluable foreknowledge that'll get you all out of this mess, I'd prefer forgetting everything and starting anew like always.” Throwing his hands up in a sincere gesture of delegation, he firmly solidifies, “Kill me, tell me to leave, demand proof—it doesn't matter to me. Just tell me what you want, and I'll do it. All of it.”

Karlach’s POV: Karlach glances from Lae’zel to Xander, and then to Astarion, her brow furrowed and lips tight in frustration. “Gods, Astarion,” she snaps, “you think this is funny?” She gestures sharply toward Xander. “He’s not just ‘doomed.’ He’s suffering. And if you’d been paying attention the past week, you’d see that.” Her voice, though rough, cracks faintly with empathy. “He tried to save someone and failed. You don’t get to treat that like a joke.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion lifts his hands in mock surrender, but the glimmer in his eyes dims as he replies, “Oh, I’m well aware he’s suffering, dear. And believe me, I’m not laughing at him. I just… see the irony. A tragedy dressed as farce. You of all people should understand—don’t you want to escape the role the gods tried to script for you?” His gaze shifts to Xander, expression tightening. “He remembers the lines. But the script keeps changing anyway.”

Gale’s POV: Gale cuts in, voice sharp but not cruel. “And while we’re debating scripts, what if he is right?” He looks between them all. “If there’s even a chance he’s telling the truth, we should be asking how we use this to our advantage. If this loop is real, then Xander could help prevent future deaths. That’s more than worth hearing him out.”

Lae'zel’s POV: Lae’zel scoffs again, folding her arms tightly. “The weakness you all display is staggering. We do not need him to survive. He knows too much. Too conveniently. It stinks of manipulation.”

Karlach’s POV: “You know what stinks?” Karlach snaps. “Your sense of self-preservation masquerading as logic. We’re not killing him, Lae’zel.”

Shadowheart’s POV: “And you think trusting him blindly is better?” Shadowheart interjects coldly. “Xander may believe what he says, but that doesn’t mean it’s real. I need more than a sad story to put my life in someone’s hands.”

Wyll’s POV: “He’s not asking for that,” Wyll interrupts, gesturing toward Xander, who has since gone quiet. “He said he’d prove it. He’s not making demands, he’s offering—and honestly? I believe him.” He looks at Shadowheart. “Maybe not about everything. But the pain, the grief? That’s real. You saw it.”

Shadowheart’s POV: “And you, Astarion,” Shadowheart continues, turning her gaze. “What was that earlier—fishing for answers, or something deeper?” Her voice is accusatory, but tinged with curiosity.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s smile falters for a second. “Let’s call it… morbid curiosity.” He straightens, folding his arms. “I merely wanted to know how I fit into his little pantomime.” He casts a sidelong glance at Xander. “Turns out, I’m not just a memory—I’m a man to him. Imagine that.”

Gale’s POV: Gale huffs softly. “Imagine treating people like people. What a concept.” He then turns toward Xander. “Show us, Xander. Show us something verifiable. Something real. Then we’ll know where to go from here.”

Xander’s POV: All eyes fall on Xander. “Alright,” he replies with a subtle nod. “For some context... I was planning on bringing us to the old, forgotten temple by the crash site tomorrow. There's a powerful ally that lies in wait for us there named Withers. So... that's what I'll be showing you.” Then, without another word, he closes his eyes and reaches out to their minds.

(This is what Astarion, Gale, Karlach, Wyll, Lae'zel, and Shadowheart witness during the tadpole mind meld):

The forgotten temples entrance comes into view. There's a small group of people—two halflings, an elf, and a human—gathered near the entrance. One of the halflings and the elf are arguing about investing the crashed spaceship (the Nautiloid) or continuing their break-in into the temple's inner depths. The party approaches, to which the halfling reacts defensively, threatening the party (this is our temple, leave or we'll kill you). The memory tappers slightly, different outcomes from different loops overlapping. In one, he persuades them to leave—convincing them that the crash site has alien invaders headed this way. In another, the intimidates them—telling them to leave with their lives while they're still breathing. Another, he just shrugs and simply attacks them. Whether this group runs off or is beaten in battle, the party moves on. Sometimes, the break a whole in the ground—which leads into a room within the temple. This, unfortunately, leads to a mini ambush (there's looters inside that go to investigate the noise—friends of those the party just disposed of). Usually though, they simply go through the door on the far end from where the encountered the group. Astarion unlocks the door, the party enters, and—they happen to catch a lone looter by surprise. The bastard is killed without much effort. Within the first room, they gather supplies (most of which the looters left lying around, such as food). Moving on to the next room, the encounter the rest of the looters (the same ones that would do a mini ambush on them if they went through the ground/ceiling). After dealing with them (by blowing up some wine barrels that the looters were standing too close to, which is always fun), they search the room, looting the looters' bodies and any valuables they can find. In the last room, an old library, there isn't much other than books. Or so it would seem. On the very far end of the library, behind a large statue, Xander happens to spot a lever—a skull with a large o ring hanging out of its mouth. He pulls it, and judging by the loud straining sound of inner workings, something within the temple was unlocked. They leave the library and, sure enough, the locked door next to it is now wide open. Upon entering, the scent of stale air hits them with full force. Nature has started to claim this part of the temple, green overgrowth making its home in the heavily worn walls and floors. Sunlight spills in from the high ceilings above in small shatters, providing little light. There are two giant doors—one on the right wall, and one on the left. Entering the door on the right, they find a room with a large stone sarcophagus in the middle. Traps line the walls and floors, but luckily, are detected by the party. Astarion disarms the sarcophagus, the trap that'll set everything else off, while the others search for loot. Upon disarming the sarcophagus and retrieving the key inside, they leave the room and unlock the remaining giant door. Inside is the largest portion of the temple—seemingly where the devout or holy were laid to rest. Dead scribes, their skeletal remains, are scattered here and there. The companions remark on the oddity, but ultimately move on. As the approach the center of the room, sunlight illuminates a massive statue—that of Jergal, scribe (God) of the dead (which Gale helpfully pointed out). He's an ancient god, one that mortals no longer worship. So, the companions wander around, finding a few valuables here and there. Then, they notice a button hidden on one of the walls. They press it, a portion of the wall next to it lowers, and—and all the dead scribes spring to life. The party deals with the suddenly reanimated dead, and once dealt with, they enter the secret room that the button revealed. Inside is the biggest sarcophagus that they’ve yet to cross thus far. Xander reaches for it, his hand barely putting pressure on it before it begins sliding open on its own. A skeletal like hand reaches out and pushes the lid of the sarcophagus off, the body rises, floats through the air, and steps down in front of the party. Black eyes land on the party, seemingly menacing, but the voice that rings out doesn't give the same impression. The being sounds otherworldly, but not threatening. This being is, of course, Withers. Withers remarks on how curious it is to awaken and find himself before the party. That their meeting is fate, basically (in his own very cryptic way). He then asks Xander: "What is the worth of a single mortal’s life?" And Xander, despite the multiple versions of this memory (and the fact that he had no foreknowledge in any of the previous loops), always answered with the same thing. "Every life is of infinite value, and merits sacrificing everything for." Withers accepts this answer and remarks, "If everyone is at war, then none shall know peace. Thus, balance is achieved. I am satisfied. We shall meet again at the proper time and place." Then bastard just wanders off after that without another word, busying himself with checking out the temple. The party just stands there for a moment before making their way out of the temple.

(The tadpole mind meld ends.)

Xander’s POV: The view of the temple fades as Xander breaks the connection. His eyes slowly open, appearing almost half lost in his own mind. With a few blinks, he clears his throat and murmurs softly, “... There you have it. That's what will happen tomorrow. And by the end of the day, Withers will become a permanent member in our camp—someone who can resurrect any of us in the case of death. He's also funny. In his own strange, bone-man way, that is.”

Karlach’s POV: Karlach exhales sharply, dragging a hand down her face. “Gods…” Her voice is hushed but potent with emotion. “That was real. That was too real. I saw it—felt it.” She spins on her heel to look at the others. “You telling me that wasn’t real? Because if it wasn’t, then I’ve gone completely bonkers, and I’m dragging you all with me.”

Gale’s POV: Gale speaks next, ever the scholar trying to maintain composure even as wonder glimmers in his eyes. “No illusion could fabricate that level of consistency, detail, and cross-referenceable knowledge.” He rubs at his temple, clearly overwhelmed but intrigued. “The level of accuracy… Gods.”

Lae'zel’s POV: “You’re all fools,” Lae’zel snaps, eyes flicking wildly from face to face. “He shows you a dream and you believe it as prophecy? We are not sycophants to a madman’s hallucinations.” She steps closer to Xander, her sneer curling. “No more tricks. If he remembers so much, let him show us how to use that knowledge—now. Or slit his throat, as he so graciously offered.”

Karlach’s POV: “You’re obsessed with slitting throats, y’know that?” Karlach growls, stepping in front of Xander without hesitation. “Maybe we use his info to not die instead of testing how many timelines we can pile up his body in.”

Shadowheart’s POV: Shadowheart crosses her arms, tight-lipped but thoughtful. “I don’t trust it,” she admits finally, “but I felt the truth in it. And that… button. The one in the tomb—who but someone who’s been there would know to press that?” Her voice lowers. “He didn’t just show us events. He presented us with the various choices made.”

Wyll’s POV: Wyll frowns, his arms crossed over his chest as he studies Xander, then looks to Gale. “You’re the magic expert. If the memory was fake, we’d know it, right?”

Gale’s POV: Gale nods slowly. “We’d feel the dissonance. But there was none. Every action had weight. Every step followed logic. That… was not fabrication.” A beat of silence.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion finally breaks it with a soft, amused scoff. “So. He really does know us. Intimately. How delightfully unsettling.” His crimson gaze settles on Xander again, not with mockery this time—but with an unnerving, quiet intensity. “Tell me, darling…” he purrs, voice like velvet but with razored undertones, “If we’re all part of your story, and you’ve known me so well… why now?” His voice drops an octave. “Why wait until all your secrets were bleeding out of you with someone else’s blood?”

Karlach’s POV: Before Xander can answer, Karlach turns on Astarion, fire in her voice. “Because he’s traumatized, you fucking jackass!” Her jaw is tight, eyes glittering with fury. “You think this is some twisted opera for your amusement? He’s breaking under the weight of a life none of us remember. Do you know what that does to a person?!”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion doesn't flinch. “Oh, I know what trauma does, my dear. I was bred in it.” The smile he offers is razor-thin. “But I’ve also learned that secrets are weapons, and he’s been holding a rather large one. Forgive me if I find it prudent to question his timing.”

Karlach’s POV: “Question it all you want,” Karlach bites back. “But I’ll tell you this—if he wanted us dead, we would be. We’re still breathing because he’s been protecting us every damn day, not plotting our end.”

Wyll’s POV: Wyll quietly adds, “He did offer to die, remember? Not exactly something a schemer does.”

Gale’s POV: Gale nods. “And now that we’ve seen proof, I say we use it. Strategically. This Withers could change the odds in our favor.”

Lae'zel’s POV: Lae’zel growls but says nothing, her glare a smoldering furnace.

Shadowheart’s POV: Shadowheart, ever the pragmatist, gives a slow nod. “Fine. Tomorrow, we test this. And if the temple plays out as he says… then maybe we start listening.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s voice, when it returns, is quieter. “I’m not finished with you, darling,” he tells Xander, tilting his head ever so slightly. “If we’re fated companions, I’d quite like to know what kind of role I play in your little tragedy. Preferably before Lae'zel takes your head as a pretty trophy, hm?” But beneath the cool tone, there’s something else. Something Astarion buries with practiced ease and refuses to acknowledge.
