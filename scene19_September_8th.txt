### Scene 19: September 8th

Xander’s POV: Xander begins the evening as he does most days. He has one-on-one conversations with each of his companions, plays with Scratch, cleans weapons, sketches—nothing out of the ordinary. But unlike most nights, Astarion left camp to go hunt. Well, that's not unusual, per say. He just… doesn't like it. Astarion’s absence feels like something tangible, and gods, it sucks. Once everyone eventually retires for the night, the camp is left in a state of quiet—which only makes Xander more restless while waiting for Astarion to return. So, in the meantime, he decides to... indulge a bit. Just a tiny bit. There's plenty of wine kicking around, and who knows? Maybe it'll distract him from how much he's bothered by Astarion’s absence. Or maybe he'll sleep better for once. Or, most likely, it won't do either and he'll simply be drunk and yearning. Either way, what's the harm in some wine? With that thought in mind, he grabs some wine and tries to concentrate on reading. An hour or so—and a bottle or two—passes. Xander, now properly feeling the buzz of alcohol, manages to catch sight of Astarion returning.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion sways on his feet as he enters camp. He wanders over to his tent, a mix of happiness and 'intoxication'—because of the bear’s blood, of course—coursing through him. It isn't long after reaching his tent that Xander approaches. He greets the bard with a slightly unrestrained grin. “There you are,” he drawls in a drunken, carefree cadence, gesturing broadly in an unsteady and dramatic manner. “My friend.” He stretches out the word "friend" delightfully, a few chuckles escaping him unbidden. Genuine amusement graces his features, making him appear more at ease than he has since… well, ever, probably.

Xander’s POV: Xander’s uninhibited smile grows, amusement and warmth practically radiating off of him. It's clear by how his sight lingers over Astarion that he appreciates seeing the rogue in a good mood. He's happy to see Astarion in general. Mirroring Astarion's cadence, he returns the greeting, his voice languid and carefree from inebriation. “And there you are,” he points at Astarion, then dramatically places a hand over his heart, “my lovely maneater.” Soft, affectionate laughter spills out of him, punctuating his words. Endearment dances behind his dark eyes as he steps closer, his body swaying ever-so-slightly. He shortens the distance between them with reckless abandon, playfully leans in—perhaps a bit too much, albeit unintentionally—and holds Astarion’s gaze. “I missed you terribly, sweetheart,” he whispers with a heavily flirtatious tone, his lilt effortlessly melodic. Then, just as suddenly, he sways out of the lean. Breathing out a melancholic sigh, the sigh itself cut short by drunken laughter, he bemoans melodramatically. “I can't believe you wandered off and cheated on me with a bear of all things! I thought I was your favorite midnight snack.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion stares at Xander. For half a beat, something unreadable flickering through his gaze before his grin splits wider, sharp and amused. He throws his head back, laughter spilling from his lips, rich and full-bodied, the kind of laughter he doesn’t allow himself to indulge in often. “Oh, darling,” he purrs, tilting his head, red eyes glinting with playful mischief. “You wound me. You know you’re my favorite. The bear was just…” he waves a hand airily, swaying slightly as he does, “a fling. No meaning, no passion. A regret, really.” He places a hand over his own chest, expression dramatically remorseful. “Can you ever forgive me, my love?” The words roll off his tongue with ease, but hells—this is fun. He likes this. The ridiculous, playful flirtation, the looseness between them, the warmth humming beneath Xander’s words. Astarion takes a slow, deliberate step forward, closing what little space remains between them, his smirk deepening as he lowers his voice. “Though, if it makes you feel any better,” he hums, his fingers ghosting over the edge of Xander’s sleeve, “I much prefer a meal I can properly savor.” His grin turns positively wolfish as he tilts his head, eyes dark with suggestion. He leans in, close enough that their noses nearly brush, reveling in the heat between them, in the delightful, intoxicating tension. Then, smooth as silk, he murmurs, “So tell me, my dear, how much wine must I ply you with before you let me devour you instead?” It’s a game, of course. A playful dance. But hells—for the first time in a long time, it’s one he doesn’t mind playing. A game he's playing willfully.

Xander’s POV: Xander is drowning. Figuratively, of course. Gods, Astarion is so close. The effect it has on him is something he doesn't actively examine in his drunken state—but is impacted by nonetheless. He's probably impacted by the closeness more than usual because of being drunk, but he's not examining that either. His half-lidded eyes drinks in the suggestive glint behind Astarion’s gaze. Unburdened laughter spills out of him, throaty yet breathless in quality—accompanied by a grin that's utterly enamored. Swaying slightly, he instinctively rests one hand on Astarion’s shoulder, the other finding Astarion’s waist. His touch is instinctive, almost thoughtless, but ultimately unassuming. “Astarion… are you trying to distract me from your infidelity with promises of wine and a good time?” he murmurs, playfully suspicious. He leans in to whisper in Astarion’s ear and chuckles, “I don't forget personal transgressions so easily, my love.”

Astarion’s POV: A sharp thrill shoots down Astarion’s spine. Xander’s hand holds his waist—steady, instinctive, comfortable. And worse, it lingers, warming Astarion’s skin through the thin fabric of his shirt. The bard’s presence is pressing in, too close, enveloping Astarion like heat from a fire. And it’s intoxicating. Not just the proximity, not just the touch—but the way Xander looks at him. Like Astarion is wanted, in a way that isn’t about ownership or conquest. A way that has nothing to do with utility. Just a natural, effortless affection that Astarion should not crave. Gods. He chuckles, low and indulgent, angling his head to the side just slightly, letting the tension stretch for a breath longer than necessary. He’s playing, yes, but he’s also stalling. Gathering himself. “Ah, but dear,” he murmurs back, voice dipped in honeyed mischief, “is it really a transgression if you secretly enjoy the betrayal?” His fingers, still barely ghosting over the edge of Xander’s sleeve, now press slightly against the fabric, not quite gripping, but enough to ground himself—to keep from sinking too deeply into this moment. He tilts his head, letting his lips hover near Xander’s ear, his smirk sharpening. “Perhaps you just like the idea of being neglected, if only so you have something to hold over me.” His voice drops further into something lower, silkier. “Tell me, my sweet, how shall I make it up to you?” The air between them is thick, a delicious tension he knows he started—but it’s Xander who makes it feel… real. Xander's laughter, that fondness, the sheer ease with which the bard leans into this dance without hesitation—it makes Astarion feel wanted. Wanted in a way he doesn't understand. And that is the real danger. So, he does what he does best. He leans in just a fraction more, lips so close to Xander’s ear they nearly brush as he whispers, “Or should I simply beg for your forgiveness? On my knees, if necessary.” A pause—deliberate, calculated—before his smirk curls, wolfish and wicked. “Though, I suspect you'd enjoy that far too much, wouldn’t you, darling?”

Xander’s POV: Xander’s mind goes blank. As Astarion’s lips nearly graze his ear, a shiver runs down his body, unbidden. Heat floods his flushed face, his heart fluttering despite himself. As if pulled out against his will, laughter slips past his lips. It’s a breathless, flustered laugh, more of a sigh than anything else. “You absolute menace,” he murmurs, the tone of his accusation almost boyish. He then tries—unsuccessfully—to school his expression into something innocent. “But I'd rather be on my knees for you, actually…” he remarks with an inebriated chuckle, utterly shameless. Then, with a teasing grin, he repeats Astarion’s words back to him. “…I suspect you'd enjoy that far too much, wouldn’t you, darling?”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion should have the upper hand here. Gods know he started this flirtatious little game. Pushed the pieces into motion. Slipped into the role he knows too well—smoldering words, feather-light touches, suggestive whispers. And yet—he’s the one reeling. The bard’s voice, dulcet and honey-thick with laughter, echoes in his ears. "But I'd rather be on my knees for you, actually…" He stills, just for a moment, but long enough to feel it hit him like a spell cast straight to the ribs. Hells. His smirk falters—barely. Just the tiniest twitch, but it’s there. Enough to give away that he wasn’t expecting Xander’s cheeky retort to feel quite so… vivid. He lets out a sharp, incredulous little laugh—equal parts impressed and off-kilter. His fingers tighten faintly where they still ghost over Xander’s sleeve, betraying the thrill of hearing those words. The image that springs to mind is delightful, devastating, and unfortunately not helpful for keeping any semblance of control. Gods, how foolish. I’m the one who provoked him, he reminds himself, a ribbon of inner exasperation winding through the haze of heat in his chest, I’m who’s supposed to be steering this. Not letting him pull the rug out from under me with one drunk, impudent whisper. And gods, look at Xander. The tilt of that grin. That flushed face and heavy-lidded gaze. Every inch of Xander right now is painted in mischief and raw affection—and none of it feels strategic. Not like his own flirtation. No, this is something far more dangerous. It’s genuine. Unrestrained. Wanted. He chuckles, soft and slow, buying himself a beat of recovery. He smooths the edges of his expression back into something smug, licking his lips as though savoring the very taste of the moment. “Oh, now that’s not fair,” he murmurs, his voice a low purr, though there's a hint more breath behind it than he’d prefer. “You can’t go stealing my best lines and turning them into offers. How’s a poor vampire meant to cope?” He leans in again, not quite touching—just close enough for the tension to crackle between them like lightning. His lips hover near Xander’s cheek, his voice a velvet drag against the skin. “Tempting, my sweet. So very tempting. But don’t think I didn’t notice you dodging the question.” A pause. A breathless beat. Then his lips curl into something sharp. “How shall I make it up to you, hmm?” he whispers, all sin and suggestion, “Do I owe you a night of indulgence? A slow, aching apology traced along every inch of that beautiful, freckled skin?” His eyes flick toward the deep scars across Xander’s throat, then up to meet those fathomless black eyes—so hard to read, and yet so open now. Or perhaps… unguarded. And gods help him, he likes it. Too much.

Xander’s POV: Xander laughs. Not because he finds Astarion’s words humorous—well, he does find it humorous, yes—but mainly because he feels overwhelmed. Overwhelmed in the best way possible. His shoulders subtly shake with mirth, his laughter unsteady, disbelieving—and utterly helpless. Somewhere in the back of his scattered thoughts, he wonders if Astarion is trying to ruin him. It certainly feels like it. Everything that Astarion does is an absolute assault to his senses. That lingering glance, those lips so agonizingly close to his skin, the cool breath filling the space between. And, by the hells, Astarion’s words. All of it might as well be a bucket of oil that was carelessly tossed into the metaphorical 'fire of desire'. He wants Astarion. And it is burning him alive. Leaning in just a bit closer, his fingers absently trace over the fabric covering Astarion’s waist and shoulder. He hums in agreement, deep and rich with sinful amusement, body swaying slightly from side to side. “Mm… if I didn't know any better, I'd assume you're trying to bed me,” he whispers against the corner of Astarion’s smile, his voice husky and teasing. “But to answer your question… I have something very specific in mind. Care to hear it?”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion should laugh. He should. Should throw out another purring remark and keep the upper hand. That’s how the game works—keep the bard off-balance, spinning in circles of wit and suggestion until he stumbles into his rhythm, not the other way around. And yet… when Xander leans in closer, voice thick with mischief and the heat of wine, whispering "But to answer your question… I have something very specific in mind. Care to hear it?"—something in him flickers. His breath stills. The space between them narrows, yet somehow stretches wide, taut with something not quite spoken. Xander’s fingers, tracing so casually over his waist and shoulder, don’t even tighten—but they anchor him. Gods, they anchor him. His own hand is still curled lightly in the fabric of Xander’s sleeve, but now it feels less like an invitation and more like a lifeline. He studies the bard’s face through a veil of heady amusement and barely restrained want. That dark, freckled skin glowing softly beneath the stars. That wicked curl of those lips. The faint blush across sharp cheekbones—flush from drink or desire, or both. Something specific, he repeats inwardly, letting the phrase roll through his mind like wine swirling in a goblet. He knows that tone, knows that look. Knows, without a shadow of a doubt, that whatever Xander’s about to say will not only catch him off guard—it’ll ruin him in the most exquisite way. And he wants it. Oh, how he wants it. But gods, does that want gnaw at something deeper. Something raw. Because this—this isn’t hollow flirtation. This isn’t a mask for leverage or lust. It’s not just wine talking. Xander means it. Xander’s not playing at affection, not teasing out power with pretend promises. The bard’s desire, and in extension, fondness, is real. And for him—a creature of pretense, survivor of centuries of abuse—it’s almost too much. Almost. His smirk lingers, but it softens at the edges. His red eyes stay locked on Xander’s, glittering in the firelight like garnets—still full of mischief, but touched now with something gentler. Something almost reverent. His voice, when it comes, is velvet and smoke, sin and silk all tangled together. “…Darling, I would kill to hear it.” Then, with a chuckle low in his chest, eyes still fixed on Xander’s, he adds, “But do be gentle. I’m ever so fragile.” It's a lie, of course. A blatant one. But one he offers with a smile that's far too soft for the sort of game they’re playing.

Xander’s POV: Xander’s smile widens. Genuine laughter bubbles up and out of him, his delight in Astarion’s response blatant, nearly childish—and wholly unabashed. “Oh, I'm nothing if not gentle with you, dear. Especially when you're willing to commit murder just to humor me,” he remarks, his words a blend of levity and adoration. With a thoughtful hum that's more irreverent than genuinely contemplative, his hands move to Astarion’s lower back and his fingers lace together. Tilting his head to the side, heavy eyes slipping shut, he attempts to gather some form of a coherent answer in his inebriated mind. “When we arrive in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate next month,” he begins dramatically, laughter lacing his words, “there's something I really want to do with you.” He pauses, purely for theatrics' sake, his eyes just barely peeking at Astarion. Sighing dreamily with a tipsy sway, he continues. “I want to bring you to this grand estate just outside the Upper City—” he chuckles, his tone softening to a playfully innocent lilt, “—and absolutely destroy those rich bastards' day. It'll involve killing them in cold blood, looting their mansion, and, most importantly, admiring you on the beautiful veranda afterwards.” More drunken laughter spills out of him as he tries to hold the feigned innocence in his tone. However, the mischievous glint in his darkened gaze and the earnest desire beneath it all proves to paint him as anything but innocent. “If you'd like, we can have a night of 'indulgence' to end the day, too,” he adds flirtatiously. “Or is all of that too specific for you?”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion is not prepared. Xander’s laughter crashes over him like a warm tide—genuine, gleeful, and utterly unguarded. It curls around the edges of his ribs and settles there, strange and stubborn and too much. That smile—so full of mischief, so blinding in its affection—should be illegal. Especially when it’s directed at him. And then Xander speaks. "When we arrive in the Lower City of Baldur’s Gate next month…" He braces instinctively for something sentimental. Some declaration or romantic fancy that might sting in its sincerity. But no—no, of course not. Not this chaotic little bard. Because what follows is murder. Beautiful, indulgent, pointedly vengeful murder. The kind Astarion thrives on. He blinks. Then again. Slower this time. His grin grows by slow degrees—sharp, delighted, curling at the corners like smoke rising from a long-smothered fire. His fangs flash, the expression halfway between affection and predation. "Destroy their day," Xander had said. "Kill them in cold blood," Xander had offered. "Admire you on the veranda," Xander had promised. And gods help him, he nearly swoons. What the hells is this man doing to me? Because it’s not the promise of bloodshed that makes his dead heart stutter—it’s everything else. The thought behind it. The way Xander’s drunk little fantasy isn’t just about murder and loot. It’s about him. Him being there. Him being admired. Him being wanted. The image floods his mind unbidden—standing on that veranda, body glistening with a sheen of exertion, spoils of a raid weighing down his pockets. Xander beside him, that infuriating little grin on the bard’s face while leaning in with a wine glass and saying something insufferably charming. Gods, it’s enough to make him ache. And then, Xander adds, "We can have a night of indulgence to end the day, too." Oh. Oh, my sweet bard. He laughs—a sharp, dazzling sound that spills from his lips like breaking crystal. There’s something raw beneath it, barely kept at bay, but he masks it well—he always does. He leans in, his forehead nearly brushing Xander’s. “Too specific?” he echoes with mock offense. “Darling, it’s perfectly specific. Murder, larceny, and lascivious rewards all in one delightful evening? How could I possibly resist?” He exhales a slow breath, letting it trail across Xander’s skin—his fingers now drifting up to settle lightly on the bard’s nape, teasing idly at the hair there. His voice lowers to something conspiratorial, indulgent, almost fond. “I must say, I do love that your wicked little mind matches my exceptionally high standards. And flair for luxury.” He pauses, his voice slipping dropping to a slow, wicked drawl. “And when the time comes, my dear… you’ll show me that veranda view. Perhaps over wine. Or over you. Either suits me.” A beat. Then his smirk widens, cocked and wicked. “And as for the night of indulgence—well,” he chuckles, breath tickling Xander’s cheek, “you may have to fight me for who ends up on their knees first.” He draws back just slightly—enough to catch the full expression on Xander’s face. And gods help him; he wants to kiss Xander. Wants it in a way that should terrify him. Instead, he smooths over that treacherous feeling with another smirk and a gentle, mock-scandalized gasp. “But first,” he purrs, “I believe you owe me wine. Or vengeance. Or both.” His eyes dance—drunk on proximity, the bard’s warmth, and the barely buried promise of something far more intimate than blood. The danger is there—looming, whispering of something too deep, of burgeoning feelings he’s not ready to name. But for now, he lets it wash over him. If he’s going to drown tonight… this is the sea he wants to drown in.
