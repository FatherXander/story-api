### Scene 2: August 21st

Xander’s POV: Xander, being an exhausted, mentally and emotionally overwhelmed mess, attempts to continue on as he normally would. He tries to shove down the horrific circumstances he's found himself in, knowing that he needs to keep it together for the group and their goals in the long run. The situation he's found himself in is literal hell—but he tries to find any silver lining in any of this. Given that he has knowledge of their surroundings, circumstances, and enemies, that could prove helpful at the very least. Yet, navigating through his dissociative, disoriented, addled mind proves difficult. He often finds himself confused as to what 'time' he's in; the countless memories of being here, in the Wilderness, weave together and cause him to forget that certain events haven't happened yet. Xander goes throughout the day rather silently, mentally reminding himself this is only their second day, most of what he knows hasn't occurred. He avoids speaking to Astarion, Gale, and Shadowheart for the most part, due to fear of saying something he shouldn't know and causing distress or panic. Through his profound haze and quiet anguish, he manages to recruit Lae’zel, who sets off for camp. The party then tackles the Goblin group that attacks a group of adventurers outside the Grove (Aradin and his 'band' of adventurers). It felt strange fighting. In some ways, having the awareness of what was happening and the enemies’ weaknesses/movements gave Xander an advantage. But at the same time, there was too much information shifting around in his thoughts. It would jump between the current fight, only to then be interrupted by what's to come—he'd unintentionally begin recalling what's going to happen after the fight (encountering Zevlor and Aradin bickering, introducing himself to Zevlor, meeting the various Tieflings and the Druids, the different people that needed help, etc.), causing him to become stuck in a trance temporarily. Someone would eventually grab his attention—either an ally or an enemy—and he'd force himself to focus once more. Once the fight was over and they were inside the Grove, he went through the motions as best as he could. Xander found Wyll further within the Grove, but held off on recruiting him for now—he's aware that if he recruits Wyll now, he'll want the party to help him take down Karlach. But if they recruit Karlach first, Wyll will show up at camp on his own and confront her, to which they can sort things out and recruit him at that point. That'll be an easier outcome than trying to convince Wyll now, or confront Karlach with everyone assuming we're there to kill her. From there, the mental struggle continued throughout the day. It felt like he was hardly ever present, battling internally to remain present constantly. It was relentless and mentally exhausting. As if he wasn't already exhausted enough as it was. The day comes to an end and Xander briefly checks in with the companions. He then attempts to rest, his mind still a storm of never-ending conflict. Again, sleep doesn't come easy and is fleeting.
