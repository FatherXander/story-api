### Scene 31: September 19th

Xander’s POV: The party works with the Harpers at Last Light Inn to ambush an Absolute convoy. This Absolute convey is led by a fanatic drider named Kar'niss. While everyone is hiding, Xander makes his presence known and speaks to the drider. Kar'niss recognizes that Xander also has a tadpole (and is a "true soul")—but realizes that Xander doesn't need a moonlatern to remain safe in the Shadowcursed Lands (this is because of a spell Isobel had cast on the party, which provides protection from the shadowcurse). Kar'niss questions why "his majesty" (the "Absolute") would bestow Xander with this gift. In response, he persuades Kar'niss into believing that Kar'niss and his party are also blessed—and that "his majesty" demands Kar'niss give Xander the moonlatern. Kar'niss hands over the moonlatern (much to the rest of the convoy's dismay). The convoy walks off into the darkness, and the shadowcurse immediately begins to infect them. What would've been a difficult fight is avoided completely. And while the convoy will remain wandering around the Shadowcursed Lands (somewhere in the old town that was ruined by the shadowcurse), he remarks that they'll be a piece of cake to finish off because of how much the shadowcurse weakens them. In other words, that's something they can leave for another day, no big deal.
