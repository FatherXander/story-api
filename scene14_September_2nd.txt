### Scene 14: September 2nd

Astarion’s POV: Astarion trails just slightly behind Xander, watching with an idle sort of curiosity. Per usual, the bard leads them forward without pause, movements practiced and sure, despite the exhaustion pressing down on the man like a weight. It’s fascinating, really. The lethargy is evident in Xander’s every breath, in the way those shoulders slump ever so slightly, yet Xander’s steps remain perfectly placed. No map, no hesitation. Xander just knows. It should be unsettling. And it is—to a degree. His eyes narrow subtly. He’s been content thus far to let things unfold, playing his role as the charming, mostly cooperative companion. But Xander is… curious. Perplexing. In ways that have been gnawing at the edges of his thoughts since the very first day. There’s too much Xander knows. Too much that Xander shouldn’t know. And, more concerningly—Xander knows Astarion. That first day still lingers in the back of his mind, a splinter just deep enough to remain irritating. The way Xander had looked at him when they met. That heart-wrenching devastation that had played across those dark features, the way that body had all but collapsed under the weight of whatever grief it carries. Not to mention that vision. Gods. He picks up his pace just slightly, sidling up alongside Xander with ease, voice lifting in its usual, teasing lilt. “You know, darling,” he begins casually, “I never tire of watching you navigate the wilderness as if it were an extension of yourself. It’s all very impressive. Almost unnatural, even.” He allows the words to settle, watching for the subtle shifts in Xander’s posture, the way his face might twitch or tighten in response. Then, lightly, he hums, tapping a finger thoughtfully against his own chin. “One might even wonder how exactly you know where to go. Every path, every turn, as if you’ve walked them a hundred times before.” He tilts his head, lips curving into a faint smirk, though there’s a knowing sharpness in his eyes. “Or should I say… fifty?” The number is a dagger’s edge, tested with purpose. He watches, waiting. Waiting to see what cracks.

Xander’s POV: As a smile slowly blooms across Xander’s fatigued features, eyes half-lidded and amused, he shoots a sidelong glance at Astarion. With a chuckle, he replies, his voice a rough, flirtatious whisper, “You've got it, baby.” More laughter spills out of him, the throaty sound punctuating his words like a deep, warm tune. Turning his attention back to the road ahead, he crosses his arms and adds, “We've all done this before, fifty or so times.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s smirk doesn’t falter, but something inside him coils tight at Xander’s response. Xander doesn’t flinch, doesn’t hesitate, doesn’t deflect—just takes the accusation and confirms it outright. "You’ve got it, baby." The words are so lighthearted, so easy. He expected—no, he was waiting for some flicker of fear, some tell of guilt or evasion. Instead, he’s met with laughter, with that rough-edged warmth Xander always carries, no matter how exhausted the bard appears to be. "We’ve all done this before, fifty or so times." The number lands with a weight he hadn’t quite braced for. Hearing it framed so casually, as if their lives had been a stage rehearsed again and again, settles something sharp in his chest. Fifty. It’s not just that Xander knows things—it’s that Xander’s lived them. Over and over and over. He narrows his eyes, though his expression remains one of playful interest. He lets the silence stretch between them just enough to be felt, waiting for the weight of what’s been said to settle before he speaks again. “Well,” he hums, tilting his head, “I do love a well-practiced performance. But this?” He gestures vaguely at their surroundings, then lets his gaze flick back to Xander. “Fifty times, and you still haven’t gotten tired of us? How sweet. Or maybe just masochistic.” His smirk sharpens, but his mind is already turning. There’s an edge of something real in Xander’s exhaustion, something that’s not just sleepless nights and endless responsibility. A decade of this? The very idea makes his skin crawl. How much has Xander seen? How much has he lost? He watches Xander for a reaction, for anything that might crack that damned effortless charm. If he’s going to play this game, he fully intends to see just how much Xander is willing to reveal.

Xander’s POV: Xander gives Astarion a narrow-eyed look, his expression one of faux offense. Taking a languid step closer, he drops his voice to a conspiratorial whisper, the low volume exacerbating his gravely tone. “Why, Astarion—it's not very nice to kink shame, you know,” he murmurs with mock-accusation, clearly teasing. “I enjoy being a sweet masochist, thank you very much.” He chuckles, filling the air between them with faint, rich laughter. Gesturing at Astarion with a lazy flourish of his hand, he continues, easy affection and levity lacing his words. “I genuinely enjoy your company, regardless of lethal space worms and looping adventures. I'll never tire of you. But I am kind of sick of the repetitive scenery.” Looking ahead, he sighs with exaggerated disappointment. “This is only the beginning, too. I might actually lose my mind if we get stuck in another loop and have to do this again.”

Astarion’s POV: Astarion has been alive for two centuries, and yet, he can't recall anyone ever saying that to him before. He’s been used, certainly. Desired, envied, feared. But enjoyed? Treasured? That’s a far rarer thing. And it should be easy to dismiss. Flattery, nothing more. But Xander has spent ten years repeating this nightmare, over and over, and still—still—says that like it’s the most natural thing in the world. As though Xander would never grow weary of him. It’s disarming. Annoyingly so. He rolls his shoulders, smoothing his expression back into one of practiced ease. “Hmm, high praise, indeed,” he drawls, as if the words don’t dig into something deeply buried. He tilts his head, letting his gaze linger on Xander—studying the exhaustion weighing on those sharp features, the casual grace despite that fatigue. “And here I thought you were growing fond of the scenery. You certainly seem to know it well enough.” There’s a brief pause before his smirk turns razor-sharp. “But another loop, you say? How dreadful. I do believe we should avoid that at all costs.” His voice takes on a languid, almost lazy purr, but there’s an unmistakable weight behind his words. “Of course, if we were to end up in yet another cycle of endless torment, at least you’d have me to keep you entertained. What would you ever do without me, after all?” The teasing is effortless, but his mind is already moving ahead. Xander has confirmed it, time and again, with his words and actions alike—the time loop is real. And, for whatever reason, Xander has memories of those previous journeys. Years worth of this one, two-to-three month long, absurd journey. And, most damning, Xander must know Astarion far too well. Far more than he likes. It’s unsettling. And yet... he can’t deny that it intrigues him.
