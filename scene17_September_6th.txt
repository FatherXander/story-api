### Scene 17: September 6th

Xander’s POV: Xander and Astarion travel to Grymforge to enact a stealth mission together. The mission itself entails killing all the Duergar in Grymforge. Xander utilizes his foreknowledge, his memories of prior loops, while they craft their plan. He notes that the party handled the Duergar in the previous loops made this fight tumultuous and difficult (given that there are so many Duergar they have to fight against). He believes that, if he and Astarion hide in a highly advantageous spot, and Astarion uses his skills as a rogue, Astarion could kill most—if not all—of the Duergar. Now, huddled together, Xander and Astarion study the Duergar down below and exchange barely audible suggestions to each other. They bounce ideas off each other easily, working together seamlessly. With everything sorted and a clear vision in place, Xander and Astarion break off. Xander crouches and hides along a portion of the wall that's still intact, having a clear view of Astarion—close enough to engage in battle if need be. Astarion hides adjacent to Xander, viewing the area below through the broken wall, a couple feet away from the edge of the broken room. Ready to enact their plan, Astarion draws into position. He carefully aims at a more secluded target, going in for the kill. Xander glances over as the anticipation rises. He's seen Astarion fight many times—an innumerable amount—but there’s something about Astarion's poised posture that is so… so effortlessly graceful, yet so powerful and lethal, that it captivates him now as it always has. As if it's the first time, somehow. Impossibly quick and quiet, Astarion fires off an arrow. It strikes the target—killing them instantly. He carefully steps back and hides, observing the area. Despite the fresh Duergar corpse that litters the floor below, Astarion remains undetected. A hot rush of excitement hits Xander, along with something... hungrier. He tries to shake it off and pay attention, reminding himself of the task at hand. His mind, however, treacherously whispers back at him, Where's the harm in a little admiring? You can't do anything except watch him. He attempts to ignore this and maintain composure as he silently watches Astarion. His attempt is in vain, though. As Astarion continues on with ease, he can feel an excitement building within him—the plan is not only working, good gods, Astarion looks remarkable while doing it. That's nothing new, of course, but—how can he make it look so good at the same time? He'd feel almost envious if it wasn't so bewitching to witness. He watches Astarion take out another. And then another. Each successful shot tugs at something that Xander doesn’t want to acknowledge at the moment, yet is undeniably there regardless. And that something is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. Before long, he's utterly transfixed—his world narrowing down to witnessing Astarion being an unstoppable force in real time. Drinking in every movement and motion as if it was the last, he struggles internally, convincing himself he's feeling appreciation for Astarion’s skills. And, well, just straight up denying the attraction and pull he feels right now. He knows it's there—it's always been there, and yet… It's not the time or place. Plus, it's disrespectful to view Astarion like that right now, is it not? We're 'working'. I've seen him in action like this hundreds of times. Just—focus on why we're here. The Duergar. Then taking out Nere… Bloody hells, how does Astarion move like that? He's so fluid and seamless. And the fact that he can so easily kill these bastards, Gods, it never ceases to be impressive—No. No. Stop… Hells, Astarion is just so— He shoves down the intrusive thoughts, forcing himself to settle on it being nothing more than an 'appreciation' for Astarion’s power and skill. Right, an appreciation. Nothing more. Just... appreciation. He hardly registers the last Duergar hitting the floor, clearing the room. Astarion is a force of nature—that prowess is thrilling, enthralling, and unbelievably attractive. “Hells, that was so hot,” he whispers to himself under his breath, his gaze mingling over Astarion, watching the rogue elegantly step back into a crouch. Registering his own words, he quickly turns his face aside, covering his mouth—flustered, awe-struck laughter escapes him, a smile breaking out across his features. He closes his eyes as more genuine, flustered laughter trickles out of him.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion peers over the edge from the shadows, watching his final kill drop to the ground below unceremoniously. The thrill of his success thrums under his skin like a live wire. And then he hears it—a breathy, almost reverent whisper, "Hells, that was so hot." For a second, he freezes, half-believing he’d imagined it. His lips twitch upwards, caught between a smirk and disbelief. Did he just say what I think he did? His eyes flick to Xander, who is turned away, clearly flustered, trying and failing to stifle laughter. Amusement bubbles up in his chest. He can’t help but feel a rush of pride. Well, well, well, someone’s clearly enjoying the show, he thinks, watching Xander’s attempt to hide that obvious embarrassment. And it is… adorable, if he's being honest. He isn’t sure if Xander realizes the transparency being currently displayed. Xander is not usually this easy to fluster, he muses, casting a sidelong glance at Xander. Over the past weeks, they’d developed a rhythm—a push and pull of flirtation and wit. But this? This is new. He’s seen Xander’s admiration before, seen the way his eyes lingered a little too long. But the raw honesty of that whispered comment, without pretense or teasing? It catches him off guard, if only for a brief moment. A slow grin spreads across his face. Hells, I do have that effect, don’t I? His amusement is tinged with something else—a faint thrill at the idea that someone as steadfast as Xander could be so affected by him, even in the middle of a mission. But naturally, he isn’t about to let that go without comment. Still crouching, he turns his attention towards Xander, his voice low and teasing. “Enjoying yourself, darling? I didn’t realize my lethal grace was such a turn-on for you,” he murmurs, his words drip with amusement. His gaze drinks in Xander’s flustered state, obviously delighted by the effect he has on the bard.

Xander’s POV: Despite fully expecting a teasing comment, Xander feels unexpectedly taken aback. As his attention snaps back to Astarion, eyes a touch wider in a mixture of surprise and disbelief, he reactively lowers his hand and gasps, “Astarion,” he balks softly, flustered and amused, though his voice is noticeably tinged with incredulity. “Turn-on? Gods, you—” His laughter cuts off his breathless reply, eyes closing as his smile grows into a grin, clearly stuck between embarrassment and amusement. Raising his hands to hide his face, he continues to laugh quietly despite himself. “Did you really just say that?” he mumbles, his words muffled by his hands.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion’s smile gains a predatory edge as Xander covers his face, laughing with obvious embarrassment. His lips twitch into a smug grin, thoroughly enjoying the sight of Xander—a man usually so composed—reduced to a flustered mess. Oh, darling, this is too rich, he thinks to himself, savoring the moment. His crimson eyes glitter with amusement as Xander continues to laugh, barely able to form coherent words. For a brief second, though, hus smirk falters. There’s something about seeing Xander so caught off-guard that sends an unexpected thrill through him—something he’s not entirely comfortable with. The honesty in Xander’s reaction, the lack of pretense, is disarming in a way that he hadn’t anticipated. He’s used to flirtation, manipulation, games—but this? This is different. Xander isn’t playing games. The bard is just… reacting. How can Xander sometimes be so easy to read, so unguarded? Does he even realize how transparent he is? he wonders, his eyes narrowing slightly as he studies Xander. He takes in the way Xander’s hands hide that beautiful, scarred face, the way those shoulders shake with barely suppressed mirth. He shakes his head and chuckles, the sound rich and teasing. “Really? Did I really say that? Of course I did, darling,” he replies, his voice low and dripping with amusement. He leans in slightly, his voice dropping to a playful whisper. “But now you’ve gone and made it far too fun for me. I’ll have to see how many more times I can make you blush like this.” His smile sharpens, full of teasing intent. Then, with a flippant and casual air, he pulls back and sighs. “Alright, my giggling bard. Shall we continue? There are so many people that need to be killed, after all.”
