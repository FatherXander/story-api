### Scene 4: August 23rd

Xander’s POV: The party—Xander, Astarion, Shadowheart and Lae’zel—decides to check out the wilderness for the day. They come across a trio on the road (whom Xander recognizes), one of the three lying on the ground dying. As they approach, the duo standing (siblings of the dying man on the ground) warn them. Xander informs them of his medicinal proficiency, and offers to check out their brother. Their dying brother has a tadpole that briefly makes a connection with Xander, and in his dying breath he remarks that the party are 'True Souls'. The siblings, having heard and understood this, explain that their brother was attacked by an Owlbear, and then ask what they should do now (they're wanting to follow the 'Absolutes' orders, which are usually delivered through their brother, who was also a 'True Soul'). Xander, feeling his chaotic, mischievous nature kick in for a moment, suggests they 'avenge their brother's death' (so, go and try to take on the Owlbear). Inwardly, Xander knows the siblings will be near the Owlbear cave up ahead, and won't venture in until the party does as well—which will prove to be helpful, as the extra numbers will aid in their task of taking out the Owlbear. Plus, seeing the sibling’s reaction to the suggestion is priceless; and knowing that Astarion gets a kick out of it only makes it funnier to Xander. After venturing around some more, they find a deceased boar that's been drained of its blood. Xander recognizes this immediately, and already knows it's Astarion’s doing. Holding back a sly smile, he checks over the dead animal, and Astarion injects a comment to try and detract Xander’s attention. Xander innocently presses, asking Astarion what he thought happened to it. Astarion hesitates at first, and then points out the teeth punctures on the boar's neck, and its notably bloodless body; concluding it must've been a vampire's doing, and he'll keep the party safe. Then, Astarion hurriedly recommends moving on, bringing an abrupt end to the conversation. Xander feels a fleeting, vague sense of fond amusement, though it's tempered by his ever dazed and tired mind. The party decides to end the day and returns to camp for the evening. Once the dead of night is upon them, the companions lie sleeping, including Xander; a rather rare occurrence, given the past few days. 

Astarion’s POV: Astarion decides to attempt to bite Xander, rationalizing it as a need to see if he can deny Cazador’s commands. That and he wants to try real blood. Not the blood of dead rats and bugs. Blood of a thinking creature, a person, alive and full of life. Gods, to feed on a person for the first time. That was one of Cazador's three rules. 'Thou must not drink from thinking creatures.' Cazador's cruel and twisted, only allowing them (Astarion and his 'siblings') to feed on dead rodents and bugs. He takes note of the companions sleeping soundly, particularly Xander. Unable to resist, he decides to make his move. Creeping over to where Xander’s resting, he leans in. However, he's immediately caught off guard by the sight of tears running down Xander’s face in spite of the bard’s unconscious state. He stops mid-lean, hovering above Xander, now close enough to hear the soft, anguished cries. He can hear the few hushed, nearly inaudible apologies that spill from Xander’s sleeping form. "I'm sorry, Astarion," just barely filters through the night air. Reeling for a moment, he pulls back suddenly. Feeling an odd mixture of shock and confusion, he tries to back off quickly—but in his haste, he nudges Xander. As Xander wakes with a start, clearly alarmed, he makes a move to get away. His defenses raise as he considers the best course of action. But Xander reacts too swiftly—much to his surprise and dismay—sitting upright and grabbing his arm before he had a chance to stand. He freezes. Panic rises, his thoughts racing over whether he can talk his way out of this or if he'll have to fight. Not wanting to have the whole camp possibly turn against him—and taking a chance on Xander’s apparent empathy—he decides that talking his way out of it first might be his best bet. “Listen! I can…” he begins, falling short as he watches Xander’s expression rapidly shift. Alarm to wild aggression—to brief realization—and then abruptly, crumbling into something apologetic and heartbroken. 

Xander’s POV: Quickly relenting Astarion’s arm, Xander rips his wide-eyed gaze away from Astarion, unable to look at him. He sits back and turns his face aside, covering his mouth with his hand, ashamed of his own reaction. His voice is low and raspy as he begins rambling, his words muffled slightly by his hand, “Shit—Astarion, I—I'm sorry—” His sight flickers to Astarion for a moment, his face glistening with the remnants of tears from his sleep. His features crease further in remorse. “I can't—I can't believe I grabbed you like that—gods,” he mutters to himself, utterly mortified, looking aside as if he's considering physically removing himself from the situation.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion takes a slight step back, composing himself swiftly. He offers a delicate, if not slightly forced, smile. “Well, this is quite the midnight revelation,” he says softly, his voice carrying a hint of sardonic amusement. “No need to apologize, darling. We all have our... moments.” He tilts his head, eyes narrowing subtly as he studies Xander’s tear-streaked face. “Though I must admit, it's not every night that I find our fearless leader in such a state. Nightmares, perhaps? The road has been harsh on all of us.” He pauses, choosing his next words carefully. “If there's something troubling you, it might help to share. After all, we're in this mess together—mind flayer worms and all.” He chuckles lightly, attempting to ease the tension while also probing for information. He continues, his tone softening just a touch. “But do try to get some rest. We need you sharp for whatever fresh hell tomorrow brings.”

Xander’s POV: Xander maintains his averted gaze at first, then lowers his hand as he draws his attention to Astarion. As Astarion continues to speak, he watches the rogue hesitantly, his features slowly relaxing. Upon Astarion concluding, he looks away and responds with a hum of agreement. He lies back down, closing his eyes and sighing softly. “Good night, Astarion,” he murmurs quietly, then shifts away from Astarion’s direction, attempting to get some more rest.

Astarion’s POV: Astarion watches Xander turn away, feeling an odd pang of curiosity and unease. For a brief moment, the vulnerability Xander displayed feels all too familiar, reminding him of the times when he had to feign emotions, only to hide the deeper wounds beneath. But he quickly pushes the thought aside, unwilling to dwell on it. Strange man, he muses internally. He's practically an enigma wrapped in distress. He casts one last glance at Xander, watching the slight rise and fall of his breathing. The tension in the air has diminished, yet he remains wary. Xander knows more than he's letting on—about everything, it seems. And that makes him dangerous. Still, if he's genuinely as broken as he looks, he could be... useful. More easily manipulated. At least for now. He gives a quiet, amused huff before making his way into the nearby forest, settling on finding sustenance out in the wilderness. Best to keep him close, play the part of the concerned ally. For now, at least. With that thought in mind, he stalks off into the darkness.
